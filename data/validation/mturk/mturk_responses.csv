He has no memory of his past following a terrible auto accident. At the start of the novel he arrives in a small town - Fort Farrell, located in the northeastern British Columbia to perform a small job for the Matterson Corporation. By chance he happens to see the name of the square in the town – Trinavant Square, which brings back some memories to him. After consulting the town newspaper he confirms that this is the place where John Trinavant used to live. He learns from a local reporter, McDougall (Mac) that John Trinavant used to be a big businessman in Fort Farrell about ten years ago with the elder Matterson – ‘Bull’ Matterson. However at that time John Trinavant had died in an auto crash along with his son (Frank) and wife. There was a fourth person found in the car driven by the Trinavants – Robert B. Grant who has presumed to be a hitchhiker travelling with them. After meeting with the head of the Matterson Corporation, Howard Matterson (son of Bull Matterson), Bob plans to start a survey of the land owned by the Matterson Corporation in the nearby forest where the Mattersons were planning to build a dam and wanted to get their land surveyed for any precious minerals. Bob starts the survey and comes across a Miss Clare Trinavant who insists that he stays out of her land. After completing the survey he reports back to Howard that nothing of value lied below their land, and collects his pay-check and leaves. But before he leaves he is confronted by Mac to reveal his interest in the Trinavants. Although he refuses to tell Mac anything he is forced to reconsider his decision. Bob thinks about his past. It is revealed that Bob Boyd is indeed none other than Robert Grant who was riding with the Trinavants when the car crashed and the other 3 occupants died. Although he survived the crash his body was badly burned and as a result he lost his memory. He is told by the doctor and the psychiatrist (Susskind) that he is Robert Grant and survived the crash. Susskind urges him to forget about his past and focus on the future. But Bob insists on knowing about his past and so Susskind tells him that he used to be a college student and had a broken family and criminal history. He had no family now and was sought by police for drug and other charges. Susskind tells him that he must forget all that and study and complete his university exams because he was a new person now. Susskind helps him get a new face by plastic surgery and they decide to give him a new name – Bob Boyd. After a little time Bob is able to go back to normal life and works in the northern Canadian territories as a prospector. Back in the present time, Bob Boyd receives news that Susskind had died and feels that he has lost all touch with his past except for Fort Farrell and decided to go back there and investigate. He goes back and meets Mac and tells him everything about his past after which Mac feels sorry for having reprimanded him previously. They decide that to stick together and investigate the Mattersons interest and involvement in Trinavant property especially since after the death of the Trinavant family the Mattersons had gained a lot of wealth. They also decide to contact Clare Trinavant, who is a distant niece of John Trinavant and inform her about Bob’s past. At this time Mac asks Bob how he knows he is Robert Grant, in other words couldn’t he also be Frank Trinavant. Mac reveals to Bob that both Bob and John were boys of same age and a mistake could have been made. If Bob were actually Frank Trinavant he would stand to gain a lot of wealth and this would upset the Mattersons a lot. After hearing this Bob starts to spread the word in Fort Farrell that he is the survivor of the crash in which the Trinavant family died to see the reaction of the Mattersons. Immediately he is called by the elder Matterson (Bull) and accused of blackmail. Bull inform him that he knows Bob is actually Robert Grant and could get him thrown in jail because of his past criminal record. Bull warns Bob to leave town immediately and not create any trouble, but Bob ignores him and tells him he can do nothing. Meanwhile Bob asks Clare her if he can survey her share of the land adjoining the Matterson’s dam because it would be flooded soon. They both go there together and survey the land. While camping together they develop a romantic interest and decide to get married sometime in the future. When they return back from the survey Bob decides to create some more panic for the Mattersons. He decides to visit the dam they are building and starts to poke around in order to provoke them. He also collects some soil samples near the dam and finds they contain quick clay. He tries to warn the Mattersons to stop building the dam lest it gets toppled due to the quick clay; instead, the Mattersons threaten him. Eventually he confronts Bull Matterson and tells him that he could also be John Trinavant. Bull is unable to hear this shocking news and gets a heart-attack. His son, Howard, spreads the rumor that Bob had hit Bull, and gets all his employees to hunt down Bob. Bob quickly learns of Howard’s plan and escapes in the woods. They all follow him in the woods and Howard also captures Clare and Mac and locks them in his cellar. Bob knows that he must quickly escape his hunters and try to free Clare and Mac. He tries several maneuvers in the forest and on one occasion tells one of Howard’s men that he did not hit Bull Matterson. Eventually, Bob is able to escape and reach the Matterson home where Bull is recuperating from his heart attack. Bull tells Bob that five years ago his son and daughter had taken his car and run down John Trinavant’s car with the intent to kill him and his family. They did not want to see the more successful Frank be the successor of the Matterson-Trinavant business. A little time later Bob learns from the police that Howard is killed by police gunshots in the forest after he had killed one of the police officers. They also are able to free Clare and Mac from the cellar. Bob races towards the Matterson dam and orders everyone to evacuate due to the danger of quick clay. In the ensuing evacuation the dam collapses and a few people die, but most of them are able to escape. At the end Bob and Clare get together and look forward to a new life together. After all, he could capture me and take ne back to Fort Farrell, and then the whole story would blow up in his face. He had to get rid of me and the only way was by another killing. I shivered slightly. I had led a pretty tough life but I had never been pursued with deadly intention before. This was quite a new experience and likely to be my last. Of course, it was still possible for me to quit. I could head further west and then southwest to the coast, hitting it at Stewart or Prince Rupert; I could then get lost and never see Fort Farrell again. Bit I knew I would not do that because of Mac and Clare - especially Clare. I dug a blanket from my pack and wrapped it round me. I was dead beat and in no fit condition to make important decisions. It would be time enough in daylight to worry about what to do next.

The novel begins with Rubashov's arrest in the middle of the night by two men from the secret police (in the USSR, it was called the NKVD). When they came for Rubashov, they woke him from a dream in which he was being arrested by the Gestapo. One of the men is about Rubashov's age, the other is somewhat younger. The older man is formal and courteous, the younger is brutal. The difference between them introduces the first major theme of Darkness At Noon: the passing of the older, civilized generation, and the barbarism of their successors. Imprisoned, Rubashov is at first relieved to be finished with the anxiety of dread during mass arrests. He is expecting to be kept in solitary confinement until he is shot. He begins to communicate with No. 402, the man in the adjacent cell, by using a tap code. Rubashov quickly realizes that they don't have much to discuss. Unlike Rubashov, No. 402 is not an intellectual; he just wants to hear the details of Rubashov's latest sexual encounter. Rubashov humors him for a time, but is too embarrassed to continue. He thinks of the Old Bolsheviks, No. 1, and the Marxist interpretation of history. Throughout the novel Rubashov, Ivanov, and Gletkin speculate about historical processes and how individuals and groups are affected by them. Each hopes that, no matter how vile his actions may seem to their contemporaries, history will eventually absolve them. This is the faith that makes the abuses of the regime tolerable as the men consider the suffering of a few thousand, or a few million people against the happiness of future generations. They believe that gaining the socialist utopia, which they believe is possible, will cause the imposed suffering to be forgiven. Rubashov meditates on his life: since joining the Party as a teenager, Rubashov has officered soldiers in the field, won a commendation for ""fearlessness"", repeatedly volunteered for hazardous assignments, endured torture, betrayed other communists who deviated from the Party line, and proven that he is loyal to its policies and goals. Recently he has had doubts. Despite 20 years of power, in which the government caused the deliberate deaths and executions of millions, the Party does not seem to be any closer to achieving the goal of a socialist utopia. That vision seems to be receding. Rubashov is at a quandary, between a lifetime of devotion to the Party, and his conscience and the increasing evidence of his own experience on the other. From this point, the narrative switches back and forth between his current life as a political prisoner and his past life as one of the Party Elite. He recalls his first visit to Berlin about 1933, after Hitler gained power. Rubashov was to purge and reorganize the German Communists. He met with Richard, a young communist cell leader who had distributed material contrary to the Party line. In a museum, underneath a picture of the Pieta, Rubashov explains to Richard that he has violated Party discipline, become ""objectively harmful"", and must be expelled from the Party. A Gestapo man hovers in the background with his girlfriend on his arm. Too late, Richard realizes that Rubashov has betrayed him to the secret police. He begs Rubashov not to ""throw him to the wolves,"" but Rubashov leaves him quickly. Getting into a taxicab, he realizes that the taxicab driver is also a communist. The raxicab driver offers to give him free fare, but Rubashov pays the fare. As he travels by train, he dreams that Richard and the taxicab driver are trying to run him over with a train. This scene introduces the second and third major themes of Darkness At Noon. The second, suggested repeatedly by the Pieta and other Christian imagery, is the contrast between the brutality and modernity of Communism on the one hand, and the gentleness, simplicity, and tradition of Christianity. Although Koestler is not suggesting a return to Christian faith, he implies that Communism is the worse of the two alternatives. The third theme is the contrast between the trust of the rank and file communists, and the ruthlessness of the Party elite. The rank and file trust and admire men like Rubashov, but the elite betrays and uses them with little thought. As Rubashov confronts the immorality of his actions as a party chief, his abscessed tooth begins to bother him, sometimes reducing him to immobility. Rubashov recalls being arrested soon after by the Gestapo and imprisoned for two years. Although repeatedly tortured, he never breaks down. After the Nazis finally release him, he returns to his country to receive a hero's welcome. No. 1's increasing power makes him uncomfortable but he does not act in opposition; he requests a foreign assignment. No. 1 is suspicious but grants the request. Rubashov is sent to Belgium to enforce Party discipline among the dock workers. After the Italian invasion of Ethiopia during 1935, the League of Nations and the Party condemned Italy and imposed an international embargo on strategic resources, especially oil, which the Italians needed. The Belgian dock workers are determined not to allow any shipments for Italy to pass through their port. As his government intends to supply the Italians with oil and other resources secretly, Rubashov must convince the dock workers that, despite the official policy, as Communists they must unload the materials and send them to the Italians. Their cell leader, a German communist immigrant nicknamed Little Loewy, tells Rubashov his life's story. He is a communist who has sacrificed much for the Party, but is still completely dedicated. When all the workers have gathered, Rubashov explains the situation. They react with disgust and refuse his instructions. Several days later, Party publications denounce the entire cell by name, virtually guaranteeing arrest by the Belgian authorities, who were trying to suppress Communism. Little Loewy hangs himself. Rubashov then begins a new assignment. In the novel, after about a week in prison, he is brought in for the first examination or hearing, which is conducted by Ivanov, an old friend. Also a veteran of the Civil War, he is an Old Bolshevik who shares Rubashov's opinion of the Revolution. Rubashov had then convinced Ivanov not to commit suicide after his leg was amputated due to war wounds. Ivanov says that if he can persuade Rubashov to confess to the charges, he will have repaid his debt. With confession, Rubashov can lessen his sentence, to 5 or 10 years in a labor camp, instead of execution. He simply has to cooperate. The charges are hardly discussed, as both men understand they are not relevant. Rubashov says that he is ""tired"" and doesn't ""want to play this kind of game anymore."" Ivanov sends him sent back to his cell, asking him to think about it. Ivanov implies that Rubashov can perhaps live to see the socialist utopia they've both worked so hard to create. The next section of the book begins with an entry in Rubashov's diary; he struggles to find his place and that of the other Old Bolsheviks, within the Marxist interpretation of history. Ivanov and a junior examiner, Gletkin, discuss Rubashov's fate in the prison canteen. Gletkin urges using harsh, physical methods to demoralize the prisoner and force his confession, while Ivanov insists that Rubashov will confess after realizing it is the only ""logical"" thing to do, given his situation. Gletkin recalls that, during the collectivization of the peasants, they could not be persuaded to surrender their individual crops until they were tortured (and killed). Since that helped enable the ultimate goal of a socialist utopia, it was both the logical and the virtuous thing to do. Ivanov is disgusted but cannot refute Gletkin's reasoning. Ivanov believes in taking harsh actions to achieve the goal, but he is troubled by the suffering he causes. Gletkin says the older man must not believe in the coming utopia. He characterizes Ivanov as a cynic and claims to be an idealist. Their conversation continues the theme of the new generation taking power over the old: Ivanov is portrayed as intellectual, ironical, and at bottom humane, while Gletkin is unsophisticated, straightforward, and unconcerned with others' suffering. Ivanov has not been convinced by the younger man's arguments. Rubashov continues in solitary. Taking over the interrogation of Rubashov, Gletkin uses physical abuses, such as sleep deprivation and forcing Rubashov to sit under a glaring lamp for hours on end, to wear him down. Rubashov finally capitulates. As he confesses to the false charges, Rubashov thinks of the many times he betrayed agents in the past: Richard, the young German; Little Loewy in Belgium, and Arlova, his secretary-mistress. He recognises that he is being treated with the same ruthlessness. His commitment to following his logic to its final conclusion—- and his own lingering dedication to the Party—- cause him to confess fully and publicly. The final section of the novel begins with a four-line quotation (""Show us not the aim without the way ..."") by the German socialist Ferdinand Lasalle. The novel ends with Rubashov's execution.",,,1170.0,1531

After the Italian invasion of Ethiopia during 1935, the League of Nations and the Party condemned Italy and imposed an international embargo on strategic resources, especially oil, which the Italians needed. The Belgian dock workers are determined not to allow any shipments for Italy to pass through their port. As his government intends to supply the Italians with oil and other resources secretly, Rubashov must convince the dock workers that, despite the official policy, as Communists they must unload the materials and send them to the Italians. Their cell leader, a German communist immigrant nicknamed Little Loewy, tells Rubashov his life's story. He is a communist who has sacrificed much for the Party, but is still completely dedicated. When all the workers have gathered, Rubashov explains the situation. They react with disgust and refuse his instructions. Several days later, Party publications denounce the entire cell by name, virtually guaranteeing arrest by the Belgian authorities, who were trying to suppress Communism. Little Loewy hangs himself. Rubashov then begins a new assignment. In the novel, after about a week in prison, he is brought in for the first examination or hearing, which is conducted by Ivanov, an old friend. Also a veteran of the Civil War, he is an Old Bolshevik who shares Rubashov's opinion of the Revolution. Rubashov had then convinced Ivanov not to commit suicide after his leg was amputated due to war wounds. Ivanov says that if he can persuade Rubashov to confess to the charges, he will have repaid his debt. With confession, Rubashov can lessen his sentence, to 5 or 10 years in a labor camp, instead of execution. He simply has to cooperate. The charges are hardly discussed, as both men understand they are not relevant. Rubashov says that he is ""tired"" and doesn't ""want to play this kind of game anymore."" Ivanov sends him sent back to his cell, asking him to think about it. Ivanov implies that Rubashov can perhaps live to see the socialist utopia they've both worked so hard to create. The next section of the book begins with an entry in Rubashov's diary; he struggles to find his place and that of the other Old Bolsheviks, within the Marxist interpretation of history. Ivanov and a junior examiner, Gletkin, discuss Rubashov's fate in the prison canteen. Gletkin urges using harsh, physical methods to demoralize the prisoner and force his confession, while Ivanov insists that Rubashov will confess after realizing it is the only ""logical"" thing to do, given his situation. Gletkin recalls that, during the collectivization of the peasants, they could not be persuaded to surrender their individual crops until they were tortured (and killed). Since that helped enable the ultimate goal of a socialist utopia, it was both the logical and the virtuous thing to do. Ivanov is disgusted but cannot refute Gletkin's reasoning. Ivanov believes in taking harsh actions to achieve the goal, but he is troubled by the suffering he causes. Gletkin says the older man must not believe in the coming utopia. He characterizes Ivanov as a cynic and claims to be an idealist. Their conversation continues the theme of the new generation taking power over the old: Ivanov is portrayed as intellectual, ironical, and at bottom humane, while Gletkin is unsophisticated, straightforward, and unconcerned with others' suffering. Ivanov has not been convinced by the younger man's arguments. Rubashov continues in solitary. Taking over the interrogation of Rubashov, Gletkin uses physical abuses, such as sleep deprivation and forcing Rubashov to sit under a glaring lamp for hours on end, to wear him down. Rubashov finally capitulates. As he confesses to the false charges, Rubashov thinks of the many times he betrayed agents in the past: Richard, the young German; Little Loewy in Belgium, and Arlova, his secretary-mistress. He recognises that he is being treated with the same ruthlessness. His commitment to following his logic to its final conclusion—- and his own lingering dedication to the Party—- cause him to confess fully and publicly. The final section of the novel begins with a four-line quotation (""Show us not the aim without the way ..."") by the German socialist Ferdinand Lasalle. The novel ends with Rubashov's execution.",,,1170.0,1531

It controls human evolution by rapidly evolving the next generation while in the womb, leading to speciation. The novel follows several characters as the ""plague"" is discovered as well as the panicked reaction of the public and the U.S. government to the disease. Built into the human genome are non-coding sequences of DNA called introns. In Darwin's Radio, certain portions of these ""non-sense"" sequences, remnants of prehistoric retroviruses, have been activated and are translating numerous LPCs (large protein complexes). The activation of SHEVA and its consequential sudden speciation was postulated to be either controlled by a complex genetic network that perceives a need for modification or a human adaptive response to overcrowding. The disease, or rather, gene activation, is passed on laterally from male to female as per an STD. If impregnated, a woman in her first trimester who has contracted SHEVA will miscarry a deformed female fetus made of little more than two ovaries. This ""first stage fetus"" leaves behind a fertilized egg with fifty-two chromosomes rather than the typical forty-six characteristic of Homo sapiens sapiens. During the third trimester of the second stage pregnancy, both parents go into a pre-speciation puberty to prepare them for the needs of their novel child. Facial pigmentation changes underneath the old skin which begins sloughing off like a mask. Vocal organs and olfactory glands alter and sensitize respectively, to adapt for a new form of communication. For over a year after the first SHEVA outbreak in the United States, no second stage fetus was recorded to have been born alive. The new human species was highly sensitive to all varieties of herpes and could not be viably born to a mother who had ever been infected with any of the virus' many forms, including Epstein-Barr and the chickenpox — thus eliminating 95% of the female population. Anesthetics and pitocin administered during childbirth were also lethal. So while many women would contract activated SHEVA, few would be able to successfully give birth, making the transition from Homo sapiens sapiens to the new human species very gradual. The international response to the threat of SHEVA was to form a special task force that would work alongside the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to find a vaccine. Because the ""disease"", called ""Herod's Flu"", was already in the genome of every person on Earth, the only two options were to either inhibit the activation of the SHEVA gene by discovering the signal it used or to abort the second stage fetus. Due to the rapid mutation rate of the missing-link signal molecule, preventing the activation of the gene was infeasible. The second option, abortion, was already a controversial issue and the proposal of handing out free RU 486 was met with social upheaval, adding to the already chaotic social scene. The general public believed that the government was either not placing due importance on the death of countless fetuses, or already had a cure and refused to release it. In response, government research facilities were forced to test prospective treatments prematurely and could not pursue explanations for SHEVA outside of the ""disease"" category because of the potential reactions from the masses. It was not until viable second stage fetuses were born that the idea of SHEVA being a part of evolution rather than a disease began to grow from a few isolated sources.",,,3280.0,571

After escaping, Alex calls a number he found on Yassen's mobile phone and hears pop star Damian Cray's voice.

Alex meets a photographer named Marc Antonio (Le' Bis""Tro) in Paris; he reveals that Sabina's father was investigating Cray, and Antonio is killed shortly afterwards by an assassin. Alex goes to Cray Industries in Amsterdam, where he hears Yassen and Cray conversing about a flash drive. Cray catches Alex as he tries to sneak away and puts him in a real-life version of Feathered Serpent, a new video game developed by Cray Software Industries (the game was just a cover for getting a huge factory to develop a flash drive). Alex escapes and steals Cray's flash drive. In response, Cray kidnaps Sabina and holds her for ransom. Alex attempts to force Cray to release Sabina, but Cray outmaneuvers him and forces Alex to hand over the flash drive. Sabina is released and apoligizes to Alex for not believing him.

Yassen comes in and forces the two to put on nuclear-proof suits. After creating a diversion using a plane full of fake nerve gas, he, Yassen, Alex, and Sabina sneak aboard Air Force One at Heathrow Airport. Cray plugs in the flash drive and activates the missiles. He then orders Yassen to kill Alex and Sabina; upon Yassen's refusal, Cray shoots Yassen and then Alex, Sabina, flying into a rage, attacks him. But before she is almost killed, Alex, saved by a bulletproof jersey (given to him by Mr. Smithers), gets up and fights Cray. Eventually, the two manage to push Cray out of the plane, along with a food service cart used by Sabina. He is then sucked into the engine and shredded to pieces. The food cart getting sucked into the engine results in the engine's destruction, causing the plane to lose control. Cray's pilot Henryk attempts to abort the plane take-off, but, as the plane has already reached V1 speed, he cannot do so safely and crashes the plane off the runway, breaking his neck in the process. Alex and Sabina survive the crash and Sabina presses a self-destruct button to destroy the missiles. As he lays dying , Yassen tells Alex that Alex's Dad, worked with him as an assassin and that if he does not believe him, to go to Venice and find something called ""Scorpia"", which is later revealed in the subsequent novel as an evil intelligence company.

Divided into four chapters, each of which is further divided into three parts, the novel is a chronological narrative of four periods in the lives of Alabama and David Knight, names that are but thin disguises for their real-life counterparts. Save Me The Waltz is the story of Alabama Beggs, a Southern girl who marries a twenty-two-year-old artist, David Knight. As with Zelda and Scott, Alabama met David when he was in the South during World War I. Knight becomes a successful painter, and the family moves to the Riviera where Knight begins an affair with an actress. Determined to be successful in her own right, Alabama decides to become a ballet dancer and devotes herself relentlessly to the cause, eventually achieving success. Alabama dances her solo debut in the opera Faust. Though outwardly successful, Alabama and David are miserable. At the novel's end they return to the South when Alabama's father dies. Though she says otherwise, her friends from the South go on about how happy and lucky Alabama is. Alabama searches for meaning in her father's death, but finds none. While cleaning up after their final party before returning to their unhappy lives, Alabama remarks — an interesting contrast to the closing lines of The Great Gatsby — that emptying the ashtrays is ""very expressive of myself.

While cleaning up after their final party before returning to their unhappy lives, Alabama remarks — an interesting contrast to the closing lines of The Great Gatsby — that emptying the ashtrays is ""very expressive of myself.

Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda Sayre Fitzgerald lived and which Scott’s novels have so indelibly written into American literary and cultural history. Divided into four chapters, each of which is further divided into three parts, the novel is a chronological narrative of four periods in the lives of Alabama and David Knight, names that are but thin disguises for their real-life counterparts. Save Me The Waltz is the story of Alabama Beggs, a Southern girl who marries a twenty-two-year-old artist, David Knight. As with Zelda and Scott, Alabama met David when he was in the South during World War I. Knight becomes a successful painter, and the family moves to the Riviera where Knight begins an affair with an actress. Determined to be successful in her own right, Alabama decides to become a ballet dancer and devotes herself relentlessly to the cause, eventually achieving success. Alabama dances her solo debut in the opera Faust. Though outwardly successful, Alabama and David are miserable. At the novel's end they return to the South when Alabama's father dies.

Laura, only 15 and a schoolgirl herself, is apprehensive as this is both the first time she has left home and the first school she has taught, but is determined to complete her assignment and earn $40 to help her sister Mary, who is attending Vinton College for the Blind in Iowa. This first school proves difficult for her. Laura must board with the Brewsters in their two-room claim shanty, sleeping on a narrow sofa behind a curtain in their bedroom. The Brewsters are an unhappy family and Laura is deeply uncomfortable observing the way husband and wife quarrel. In one particularly unsettling incident, she wakes in the night to see Mrs. Brewster standing over her husband with a knife. Mrs. Brewster seems to resent Laura particularly, and is rarely pleasant to her. Laura does not like teaching school, but feels that at least going to the schoolhouse keeps her away from Mrs. Brewster, and steels herself to spend all of Saturday and Sunday in the Brewster house. To her surprise and delight, homesteader Almanzo Wilder (with whom she became acquainted in Little Town on the Prairie) appears at the end of her first week of school in his new two-person cutter to bring her home for the weekend. Already fond of Laura and wanting to ease her homesickness, Almanzo takes it upon himself to bring her home and return her to the Brewsters each weekend of that term -- once, on a dangerously frigid day when the temperature drops lower than -40° -- even though she at one point tells him she is only going with him because she wants to go home. The winter passes slowly. The weather is bitterly cold, though not so badly as the Hard Winter, and neither the claim shanty or the school house can be heated adequately. Some of the children Laura is teaching are older than Laura herself, and she has difficulty motivating them. With advice from Ma (a former schoolteacher herself), Laura is able to adapt and become more self-assured, and successfully completes the two-month assignment. Pa brings her the $40, and she gives it back to him to use for Mary's college education. Though Laura believed she would not see Almanzo again after school ended, she happily accepts an invitation to go on a sleigh ride with him the next weekend, and so their relationship continues. Sleigh rides give way to buggy rides in the spring, and Laura impresses Almanzo with her willingness to help break his new and often temperamental horses. Laura's old nemesis Nellie Oleson makes a brief appearance during two Sunday buggy rides with Almanzo, who later explains to Laura that he only offered Nellie a ride because he felt sorry for her. Nellie's chatter and flirtatious behavior towards Almanzo annoy Laura, who flatly refuses to ride with Almanzo if he continues seeing Nellie. Shortly thereafter, Nellie moves back to New York after her family loses their homestead. In between, Laura's Uncle Tom (Ma's brother) visits the family and tells of his failed venture with a covered wagon brigade seeking gold in the Black Hills, in which they built a stockade but were driven out of it by U.S. soldiers. Laura moves with seamstress Mrs. McKee to the McKee's claim when Mrs. McKee moves there to fulfill the residency requirements necessary to hold the claim. When Mary returns home for summer vacation, Mrs. McKee tells Laura she can go home. The family finances have improved with the increase in their livestock to the point that Pa can sell a cow to purchase a sewing machine for Ma. Laura receives another teaching certificate and teaches at a nearby school, for which she is paid $75; Pa uses the money to purchase a parlor organ to surprise Mary when she returns home from college. Almanzo invites Laura to attend summer ""singing school"" with him and her classmates, which they both enjoy. On the last evening of singing school while driving Laura home, Almanzo -- who has by now been courting Laura for three years -- proposes to Laura. She tells him ""it would depend on the ring."" During their next ride, Almanzo presents Laura with a gold ring set with a garnet and pearls, which she accepts, and they share their first kiss. During their engagement, Laura teaches one final term of school, and she and Ma begin working on the linens and clothing necessary for Laura to begin a household of her own after marriage. Almanzo is nearly finished building their house on his tree claim, when he asks Laura if she would mind getting married within a few days; his sister and mother have their hearts set on a church wedding, which Pa cannot yet afford. Laura agrees, and she and Almanzo are married by the Reverend Brown in a simple ceremony. After a wedding dinner with her family, Laura drives away with Almanzo and the newlyweds settle contentedly into their new home.",,,6811.0,851

He is living in a time of unrest, when nobles treat peasants like himself as dirt. The region is ruled over by a tyrannical ruler named Baldwin. Seeking freedom, he joins the Crusades. However, when they manage to invade one of the Turk Cities, he sees the horror around him, and decides he cannot face it. He passes a church, where he sees a priest being beaten, and kills the men attacking him. At the now dead priest's side lays a staff, which Hugh decides to carry with him from then on. Hugh flees the Holy Land, returning to his home village of Veille du Pere, to find his wife kidnapped, his son Phillipe dead (whom his wife Sophie gave birth to after he left) and his inn destroyed. Townsfolk say the attackers wore no colors except for black crosses sewn onto their tunics, and were dishonored knights who seemed to be looking for him alone. Half mad with grief, he wanders into the forest, then goes to search for Sophie who he believes is still alive and being held captive in the dungeons at Treille. In the woods, he attacked by a boar which although he kills, wounds him badly. He is saved by Emilie, a woman who reminds him of Sophie. She turns out to be highborn, the daughter of the King of France, though he does not learn of this until much later. Hugh's plan is to infiltrate the castle of Lord Baldwin at Treille. With Emilie and the jester (at Boree) Norbert's help, he adopts the pretext of a Jester. After winning his Lord and the Lord's crowds' ear, he soon finds that his wife was never in Treille, with Baldwin. He travels to Borée to see Emilie once more. Winning Anne (Emilie's mistress)'s ear, he eventually finds that his wife, Sophie was in the dungeon of Borée all along, and that Anne had been lying to him. Killing three of the Tafurs (the guards of Anne which turn out to be the dishonored knights who took his wife), Hugh runs back to Veille du Pere. By then he is sure men are hunting him, but he knows not for what. The Tafurs launch an attack on Veille du Pere, but Hugh and his friends had prepared traps, and so killed all of them but one. This one attacks Hugh before his escape, and breaks his staff, but not the object within, which turns out to be the Holy Lance that pierced Jesus Christ's side as he lay on the cross. Peasants flock to the spear, so Hugh marches on Treille and takes Baldwin prisoner. Next he marches on Borée, but try as they might, they could not take it. Finally the leader of the Tafurs, ""Black Cross"" attacks Hugh and his Peasant army, but they rebuff them, Hugh killing Black Cross as they did so. Stephen (Anne's evil husband who had recently returned from the Crusades), threatened to kill Emilie, but a plot by Hugh and Anne save her.

They attempt to delete a vagrant AI in the form of a little girl in a red dress, but their attempt fails and she escapes. In the first chapter, we are introduced to Albireo. He cheats his way into the lowest level of the dungeon and meets the Vagrant AI. Through text chat, she reveals her name to be Lycoris. The end-of-dungeon treasure was an item named ""eciov.cyl"", which Albiero traded to Lycoris by her request. In the game, she gains her voice. Lycoris teleports them without warning to his home, where there was currently a massive monster attack. A newbie player, Hokuto, appeals to Albireo to help her. He is forced to help her and finish the event involuntarily, gaining an item ""rae.cyl"". This is also traded to Lycoris. Hokuto manages to blackmail him into letting her into his empty friend's list, and then into forming a party of the two of them. Due to this, Hokuto was able to see Lycoris. Albireo was also approached by Orca and Balmung to ask for assistance in resolving the ""One Sin"", an event considered unbeatable. He declined however. He was unable to log out from The World, but was able to continue with his normal life (unlike infected characters later in the .hack series, who fell into comas). Upon returning, he headed to the ""One Sin"" location. Hokuto met him there, and they witnessed Orca and Balmung defeat the boss character there. Upon its defeat, an angel appeared, trailing feathers. Lycoris requested that Albireo find a red feather, which turned out to be ""eye.cyl"". This restored Lycoris' sight. Lycoris brought them to another zone. She entered a phantom spring, and Albireo gained ""yromem.cyl"". Returning to the area in the prologue, Albireo gives Lycoris the item. She regains her memory and realizes that Albireo is none other than Watarai, the Cobalt Knight who had first tried to delete her. Watarai had attempted to complete the event in order to delete the previously fragmented Lycoris. She informs him of the existence of Morganna Mode Gone and the fact that she was a failed prototype of Aura, and reveals the last fragment of herself, hidden in Albireo's spear: ""etaf.cyl"".

Volume One The first volume concerns Richard Carvel's boyhood and schooldays. Orphaned at an early age, Richard is raised by his grandfather, Lionel Carvel of Carvel Hall, a wealthy loyalist respected by all sections of the community. Richard describes their way of life, his growing love for his neighbor, Dorothy Manners, and the hostility of his uncle, Grafton Carvel. Richard witnesses a demonstration against a tax collector in Annapolis as a result of the Stamp Act 1765 and grieves his grandfather by his adoption of revolutionary political views. Volume Two Mr Allen, Richard's new tutor, tricks him into deceiving his ailing grandfather. Richard is tormented by the coquettishness of Dorothy. At Richard's eighteenth birthday party, he learns that she is to go to England. Volume Three With the third volume, the main action of the novel begins. Through the scheming of Grafton Carvel and Mr Allen, Richard fights a duel with Lord Comyn. He is wounded, but becomes fast friends with the lord. His grandfather learns that his political opinions are unchanged but forgives him, partly through the intercession of Colonel Washington. After his recovery, Richard is attacked on the road and kidnapped. He is taken aboard a pirate ship, the Black Moll. There is a fight with a brigantine, in which the pirate ship sinks. Volume Four In the fourth volume, the protagonist continues to meet with sudden reversals of fortune. Richard is rescued and befriended by the captain of the brigantine, John Paul, who is sailing to Solway. In Scotland, John Paul is shunned, and vows to turn his back on his country. They take a post chaise to London, and in Windsor meet Horace Walpole. In London they are imprisoned in a sponging-house, from where they are rescued by Lord Comyn and Dorothy. Volume Five Volumes five and six are set in London, where the glamor and corruption of fashionable society forms a contrast with the plain and honest values of the emerging republic, embodied in the protagonist. Richard is introduced to London society, where Dorothy is an admired beauty. He makes friends with Charles James Fox and incurs the enmity of the Duke of Chartersea. Richard declares his love to Dorothy but is rejected. Volume Six Richard risks his life in a wager but survives against the odds. He visits the House of Commons, and hears Edmund Burke and Fox speak. At Vauxhall Gardens he is tricked into a duel with the Duke, while Lord Comyn is injured saving him from a second assailant. Later he hears that his grandfather has died, and that his uncle Grafton has inherited the estate, leaving him penniless. Volume Seven Richard returns to America, where he learns his grandfather had believed him dead. Rejecting Grafton's overtures, he accepts a place as Mr Swain's factor, and for the next few years faithfully tends the Swain estate, Gordon's Pride. In 1774, the discontent among the colonists begins to escalate. Volume Eight The final volume sees the dual, interlinked fruition of the two principal aspects of the novel: the political and the romantic. With the coming of war, Richard sets out to fight for his country. He meets John Paul, now calling himself John Paul Jones, and plans to join the nascent American navy. The early years of the war are represented by a summary by Daniel Clapsaddle Carvel, and Richard's narrative resumes at the start of the North Sea action between the Bonhomme Richard, captained by Jones, and the Serapis. Richard is severely wounded, and Jones arranges for him to be nursed by Dorothy. The end of the book sees Richard back in Maryland as master of Carvel Hall, married to his childhood sweetheart.",,,9462.0,655

His life as a self-regarded ""Master of The Universe"" on Wall Street is destroyed when he and his mistress, Maria Ruskin, accidentally enter the Bronx at night while they are driving to Manhattan from Kennedy Airport. Finding the ramp back to the highway blocked by trash cans and a tire, McCoy exits the car to clear the way. Approached by two black men whom they perceive—uncertainly, in Sherman's case—as predators, McCoy and Ruskin flee. Having taken the wheel of the car, which fishtails as they race away, Ruskin apparently strikes one of the two—a ""skinny boy"". Peter Fallow, a has-been, alcoholic journalist for the tabloid City Light, is soon given the opportunity of a lifetime when he is persuaded to write a series of articles about Henry Lamb, a black youth who has allegedly been the victim of a hit and run by a wealthy white driver. Fallow cynically tolerates the manipulations of the Reverend Bacon, a Harlem religious and political leader who sees the hospitalized boy as a projects success story done wrong. Fallow's series of articles on the matter ignites a series of protests and media coverage of the Lamb case. Up for re-election and accused of foot-dragging in the Lamb case, the media-obsessed Bronx District Attorney Abe Weiss pushes for McCoy's arrest. The evidence consists of McCoy's damaged car, which matches the description of the vehicle involved in the alleged hit and run, plus McCoy's evasive response to police questioning. The arrest all but ruins McCoy; he loses his job, his wealthy friends desert him, and his wife leaves him and takes their daughter. Hoping to impress his boss as well as an attractive woman, Shelly Thomas, Assistant District Attorney Larry Kramer aggressively prosecutes the case, opening with an unsuccessful bid to set McCoy's bail at $250,000. Released on bail, McCoy is besieged by demonstrators who are protesting outside his $3 million Park Avenue co-op. Fallow hears a rumor that Maria was at the wheel of McCoy's car when it allegedly struck Lamb, but Maria has fled the country. Trying to smoke out the truth, on the pretense of interviewing the rich and famous, Fallow meets Maria's husband, Arthur, at a pricey French restaurant. While recounting his life, Arthur has a fatal seizure, as disturbed patrons and an annoyed maître d' look on. Maria is forced to return to the United States for his funeral, where McCoy confronts her about being ""the only witness"". Fallow, hoping also to talk with Maria, overhears this. Fallow's write-up of the association between McCoy and Maria prompts Assistant D.A. Kramer to offer Maria a deal: corroborate the other witness and receive immunity—or be treated as an accomplice. Maria recounts this to McCoy while he is wearing a wire. When a private investigator employed by McCoy's lawyer, Tommy Killian, discovers a recording of a conversation that contradicts Maria's grand jury testimony, the judge assigned to the case declares the testimony ""tainted"" and dismisses the case. As the epilogue, a fictional New York Times article informs us that Fallow has won the Pulitzer Prize and married the daughter of City Light owner Gerald Steiner, while Ruskin has escaped prosecution and remarried. McCoy's re-trial ends in a hung jury, split along racial lines. Kramer is removed from the prosecution after it is revealed he was involved with Shelly Thomas in a sexual tryst at the apartment formerly used by Maria and McCoy. It is additionally revealed that McCoy has lost a civil trial to the Lamb family and, pending appeal, has a $12 million liability, which has resulted in the freezing of his assets. The all-but-forgotten Henry Lamb succumbs to his injuries; McCoy, penniless and estranged from his wife and daughter, awaits trial for vehicular manslaughter.

His life as a self-regarded ""Master of The Universe"" on Wall Street is destroyed when he and his mistress, Maria Ruskin, accidentally enter the Bronx at night while they are driving to Manhattan from Kennedy Airport. Finding the ramp back to the highway blocked by trash cans and a tire, McCoy exits the car to clear the way. Approached by two black men whom they perceive—uncertainly, in Sherman's case—as predators, McCoy and Ruskin flee. Having taken the wheel of the car, which fishtails as they race away, Ruskin apparently strikes one of the two—a ""skinny boy"". Peter Fallow, a has-been, alcoholic journalist for the tabloid City Light, is soon given the opportunity of a lifetime when he is persuaded to write a series of articles about Henry Lamb, a black youth who has allegedly been the victim of a hit and run by a wealthy white driver. Fallow cynically tolerates the manipulations of the Reverend Bacon, a Harlem religious and political leader who sees the hospitalized boy as a projects success story done wrong. Fallow's series of articles on the matter ignites a series of protests and media coverage of the Lamb case. Up for re-election and accused of foot-dragging in the Lamb case, the media-obsessed Bronx District Attorney Abe Weiss pushes for McCoy's arrest. The evidence consists of McCoy's damaged car, which matches the description of the vehicle involved in the alleged hit and run, plus McCoy's evasive response to police questioning. The arrest all but ruins McCoy; he loses his job, his wealthy friends desert him, and his wife leaves him and takes their daughter. Hoping to impress his boss as well as an attractive woman, Shelly Thomas, Assistant District Attorney Larry Kramer aggressively prosecutes the case, opening with an unsuccessful bid to set McCoy's bail at $250,000. Released on bail, McCoy is besieged by demonstrators who are protesting outside his $3 million Park Avenue co-op. Fallow hears a rumor that Maria was at the wheel of McCoy's car when it allegedly struck Lamb, but Maria has fled the country. Trying to smoke out the truth, on the pretense of interviewing the rich and famous, Fallow meets Maria's husband, Arthur, at a pricey French restaurant. While recounting his life, Arthur has a fatal seizure, as disturbed patrons and an annoyed maître d' look on. Maria is forced to return to the United States for his funeral, where McCoy confronts her about being ""the only witness"". Fallow, hoping also to talk with Maria, overhears this. Fallow's write-up of the association between McCoy and Maria prompts Assistant D.A. Kramer to offer Maria a deal: corroborate the other witness and receive immunity—or be treated as an accomplice. Maria recounts this to McCoy while he is wearing a wire. When a private investigator employed by McCoy's lawyer, Tommy Killian, discovers a recording of a conversation that contradicts Maria's grand jury testimony, the judge assigned to the case declares the testimony ""tainted"" and dismisses the case. As the epilogue, a fictional New York Times article informs us that Fallow has won the Pulitzer Prize and married the daughter of City Light owner Gerald Steiner, while Ruskin has escaped prosecution and remarried. McCoy's re-trial ends in a hung jury, split along racial lines. Kramer is removed from the prosecution after it is revealed he was involved with Shelly Thomas in a sexual tryst at the apartment formerly used by Maria and McCoy. It is additionally revealed that McCoy has lost a civil trial to the Lamb family and, pending appeal, has a $12 million liability, which has resulted in the freezing of his assets. The all-but-forgotten Henry Lamb succumbs to his injuries; McCoy, penniless and estranged from his wife and daughter, awaits trial for vehicular manslaughter.

The fakeer was seated on a little old bedstead reading the Koran, with his patched cloak thrown over his shoulders. The king asked him what he was reading; and he said he was reading about Paradise, and praying that he might be worthy to enter there. Then they began to talk, and, by-and- bye, the king asked the fakeer if he could show him a glimpse of Paradise, for he found it very difficult to believe in what he could not see. The fakeer replied that he was asking a very difficult, and perhaps a very dangerous, thing; but that he would pray for him, and perhaps he might be able to do it; only he warned the king both against the dangers of his unbelief, and against the curiosity which prompted him to ask this thing. However, the king was not to be turned from his purpose, and he promised the fakeer always to provided him with food, if he, in return, would pray for him. To this the fakeer agreed, and so they parted. Time went on, and the king always sent the old fakeer his food according to his promise; but, whenever he sent to ask him when he was going to show him Paradise, the fakeer always replied: ‘Not yet, not yet!’After a year or two had passed by, the king heard one day that the fakeer was very ill– indeed, he was believed to be dying. Instantly he hurried off himself, and found that it was really true, and that the fakeer was even then breathing his last. There and then the king besought him to remember his promise, and to show him a glimpse of Paradise. The dying fakeer replied that if the king would come to his funeral, and, when the grave was filled in, and everyone else was gone away, he would come and lay his hand upon the grave, he would keep his word, and show him a glimpse of Paradise. At the same time he implored the king not to do this thing, but to be content to see Paradise when God called him there. Still the king’s curiosity was so aroused that he would not give way. Accordingly, after the fakeer was dead, and had been buried, he stayed behind when all the rest went away; and then, when he was quite alone, he stepped forward, and laid his hand upon the grave! Instantly the ground opened, and the astonished king, peeping in, saw a flight of rough steps, and, at the bottom of them, the fakeer sitting, just as he used to sit, on his rickety bedstead, reading the Koran! At first the king was so surprised and frightened that he could only stare; but the fakeer beckoned to him to come down, so, mustering up his courage, he boldly stepped down into the grave. The fakeer rose, and, making a sign to the king to follow, walked a few paces along a dark passage. Then he stopped, turned solemnly to his companion, and, with a movement of his hand, drew aside as it were a heavy curtain, and revealed–what? No one knows what was there shown to the king, nor did he ever tell anyone; but, when the fakeer at length dropped the curtain, and the king turned to leave the place, he had had his glimpse of Paradise! Trembling in every limb, he staggered back along the passage, and stumbled up the steps out of the tomb into the fresh air again. The dawn was breaking. It seemed odd to the king that he had been so long in the grave. It appeared but a few minutes ago that he had descended, passed along a few steps to the place where he had peeped beyond the veil, and returned again after perhaps five minutes of that wonderful view! And what WAS it he had seen? He racked his brains to remember, but he could not call to mind a single thing! How curious everything looked too! Why, his own city, which by now he was entering, seemed changed and strange to him! The sun was already up when he turned into the palace gate and entered the public durbar hall. It was full; and there upon the throne sat another king! The poor king, all bewildered, sat down and stared about him. Presently a chamberlain came across and asked him why he sat unbidden in the king’s presence. ‘But I am the king!’ he cried. ‘What king?’ said the chamberlain. ‘The true king of this country,’ said he indignantly. Then the chamberlain went away, and spoke to the king who sat on the throne, and the old king heard words like ‘mad,’ ‘age,’ ‘compassion.’ Then the king on the throne called him to come forward, and, as he went, he caught sight of himself reflected in the polished steel shield of the bodyguard, and started back in horror! He was old, decrepit, dirty, and ragged! His long white beard and locks were unkempt, and straggled all over his chest and shoulders. Only one sign of royalty remained to him, and that was the signet ring upon his right hand. He dragged it off with shaking fingers and held it up to the king. ‘Tell me who I am,’ he cried; ‘there is my signet, who once sat where you sit–even yesterday!’The king looked at him compassionately, and examined the signet with curiosity. Then he commanded, and they brought out dusty records and archives of the kingdom, and old coins of previous reigns, and compared them faithfully. At last the king turned to the old man, and said: ‘Old man, such a king as this whose signet thou hast, reigned seven hundred years ago; but he is said to have disappeared, none know whither; where got you the ring?’Then the old man smote his breast, and cried out with a loud lamentation; for he understood that he, who was not content to wait patiently to see the Paradise of the faithful, had been judged already. And he turned and left the hall without a word, and went into the jungle, where he lived for twenty-five years a life of prayer and meditations, until at last the Angel of Death came to him, and mercifully released him, purged and purified through his punishment.",India,,408.0,1078

Why, his own city, which by now he was entering, seemed changed and strange to him! The sun was already up when he turned into the palace gate and entered the public durbar hall. It was full; and there upon the throne sat another king! The poor king, all bewildered, sat down and stared about him. Presently a chamberlain came across and asked him why he sat unbidden in the king’s presence. ‘But I am the king!’ he cried. ‘What king?’ said the chamberlain. ‘The true king of this country,’ said he indignantly. Then the chamberlain went away, and spoke to the king who sat on the throne, and the old king heard words like ‘mad,’ ‘age,’ ‘compassion.’ Then the king on the throne called him to come forward, and, as he went, he caught sight of himself reflected in the polished steel shield of the bodyguard, and started back in horror! He was old, decrepit, dirty, and ragged! His long white beard and locks were unkempt, and straggled all over his chest and shoulders. Only one sign of royalty remained to him, and that was the signet ring upon his right hand. He dragged it off with shaking fingers and held it up to the king. ‘Tell me who I am,’ he cried; ‘there is my signet, who once sat where you sit–even yesterday!’The king looked at him compassionately, and examined the signet with curiosity. Then he commanded, and they brought out dusty records and archives of the kingdom, and old coins of previous reigns, and compared them faithfully. At last the king turned to the old man, and said: ‘Old man, such a king as this whose signet thou hast, reigned seven hundred years ago; but he is said to have disappeared, none know whither; where got you the ring?’Then the old man smote his breast, and cried out with a loud lamentation; for he understood that he, who was not content to wait patiently to see the Paradise of the faithful, had been judged already. And he turned and left the hall without a word, and went into the jungle, where he lived for twenty-five years a life of prayer and meditations, until at last the Angel of Death came to him, and mercifully released him, purged and purified through his punishment.",India,,408.0,1078

We will set it beneath the altar, and not touch it until we are really in need of it.”{ Listen to Cat and Mouse in Partnership plus hundreds of other fairy tale audiobooks in the Fairytalez Audio Book App for Apple and Android devices} So the pot was placed in safety, but it was not long before the cat had a great longing for it, and said to the mouse, “I want to tell you something, little mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and has asked me to be godmother; he is white with brown spots, and I am to hold him at the christening. Let me go out today, and you look after the house by yourself.” “Yes, yes,” answered the mouse, “by all means go, and if you get anything very good, think of me, I should like a drop of sweet red christening wine too.” All this, however, was untrue; the cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to be godmother. She went straight to the church, stole to the pot of fat, began to lick at it, and licked the top of the fat off. “Then she took a stroll on the house-tops and reflected on her proceedings.” Illustration by Arthur Rackham, published in The Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm (1916), Doubleday, Page. Then she took a walk upon the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then stretched herself in the sun, and licked her lips whenever she thought of the pot of fat, and not until it was evening did she return home. Illustration by Walter Crane. Well, here you are again,” said the mouse, “no doubt you have had a merry day.” “All went off well,” answered the cat. “What name did they give the child?” “Top off!” said the cat quite coolly. “Top off!” cried the mouse, “that is a very odd and uncommon name, is it a usual one in your family?” “What does it signify,” said the cat, “it is not worse than Crumb-stealer, as your godchildren are called.” Before long the cat was seized by another fit of longing. She said to the mouse, “You must do me a favour, and once more manage the house for a day alone. I am again asked to be godmother, and, as the child has a white ring round its neck, I cannot refuse.” The good mouse consented, but the cat crept behind the town walls to the church, and devoured half the pot of fat. “Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to oneself,” said she, and was quite satisfied with her day’s work. When she went home the mouse inquired, “And what was this child christened?” “Half-done,” answered the cat. “Half-done! What are you saying? I never heard the name in my life, I’ll wager anything it is not in the calendar!” The cat’s mouth soon began to water for some more licking. “All good things go in threes,” said she, “I am asked to stand godmother again. The child is quite black, only it has white paws, but with that exception, it has not a single white hair on its whole body; this only happens once every few years, you will let me go, won’t you?” “Top-off! Half-done!” answered the mouse, “they are such odd names, they make me very thoughtful.” “You sit at home,” said the cat, “in your dark-grey fur coat and long tail, and are filled with fancies, that’s because you do not go out in the daytime.” During the cat’s absence the mouse cleaned the house, and put it in order, but the greedy cat entirely emptied the pot of fat. “When everything is eaten up one has some peace,” said she to herself, and well filled and fat she did not return home till night. The mouse at once asked what name had been given to the third child. “It will not please you more than the others,” said the cat. “He is called All-gone.” “All-gone,” cried the mouse, “that is the most suspicious name of all! I have never seen it in print. All-gone; what can that mean?” and she shook her head, curled herself up, and lay down to sleep. From this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother, but when the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found outside, the mouse thought of their provision, and said, “Come, cat, we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves we shall enjoy that.” “Yes,” answered the cat, “you will enjoy it as much as you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the window.” They set out on their way, but when they arrived, the pot of fat certainly was still in its place, but it was empty. “Alas!” said the mouse, “now I see what has happened, now it comes to light! You a true friend! You have devoured all when you were standing godmother. First top off, then half done, then–” “Will you hold your tongue,” cried the cat, “one word more, and I will eat you too.” “All gone” was already on the poor mouse’s lips; scarcely had she spoken it before the cat sprang on her, seized her, and swallowed her down.

On the way home he had to pass a pond, and already from afar he heard the frogs crying, “Aik, aik, aik, aik.” “Well,” said he to himself, “they are talking without rhyme or reason, it is seven that I have received, not eight.” When he got to the water, he cried to them, “Stupid animals that you are! Don’t you know better than that? It is seven thalers and not eight.” The frogs, however, stood to their, “aik, aik, aik, aik.” “Come, then, if you won’t believe it, I can count it out to you,” and he got his money out of his pocket and counted out the seven coins, always reckoning four and twenty groschen to a coin. The frogs, however, would not pay any attention to his reckoning, but still cried, “aik, aik, aik, aik.” “What,” cried the peasant, quite angry, “since you are determined to know better than I, count it yourselves,” and threw all the money into the water to them. He stood still and wanted to wait until they were done and had brought him his own again, but the frogs maintained their opinion and cried continually “aik, aik, aik, aik,” and besides that, did not throw the money out again. He still waited a long while until evening came on and he was forced to go home. Then he abused the frogs and cried, “You water-splashers, you thick-heads, you goggle-eyes, you have great mouths and can screech till you hurt one’s ears, but you cannot count seven thalers! Do you think I’m going to stand here till you get done?” And with that he went away, but the frogs still cried, “aik, aik, aik, aik,” after him till he went home quite angry. After a while he bought another cow, which he killed, and he made the calculation that if he sold the meat well he might gain as much as the two cows were worth, and have the skin into the bargain. When therefore he got to the town with the meat, a great troop of dogs were gathered together in front of the gate, with a large greyhound at the head of them, which jumped at the meat, snuffed at it, and barked, “Wow, wow, wow.” As there was no stopping him, the peasant said to him, “Yes, yes, I know quite well that you are saying, ‘wow, wow, wow,’ because you want some of the meat; but I should fare badly if I were to give it to you.” The dog, however, answered nothing but “wow, wow.” “Will you promise not to devour it all then, and will you go bail for my companions?” “Wow, wow, wow,” said the dog. “Well, if you insist on it, I will leave it for you; I know you well, and know who is your master; but this I tell you, I must have my money in three days or else it will go ill with you; you must just bring it out to me.” Thereupon he unloaded the meat and turned back again, the dogs fell upon it and loudly barked, “wow, wow.” The countryman, who heard them from afar, said to himself, “Hark, now they all want some, but the big one is responsible to me for it.” When three days had passed, the countryman thought, “Tonight my money will be in my pocket,” and was quite delighted. But no one would come and pay it. “There is no trusting any one now,” said he; and at last he lost patience, and went into the town to the butcher and demanded his money. The butcher thought it was a joke, but the peasant said, “Jesting apart, I will have my money! Did not the great dog bring you the whole of the slaughtered cow three days ago?” Then the butcher grew angry, snatched a broomstick and drove him out. “Wait a while,” said the peasant, “there is still some justice in the world!” and went to the royal palace and begged for an audience. He was led before the King, who sat there with his daughter, and asked him what injury he had suffered. “Alas!” said he, “the frogs and the dogs have taken from me what is mine, and the butcher has paid me for it with the stick,” and he related at full length all that had happened. Thereupon the King’s daughter began to laugh heartily, and the King said to him, “I cannot give you justice in this, but you shall have my daughter to wife for it, in her whole life she has never yet laughed as she has just done at you, and I have promised her to him who could make her laugh. You may thank God for your good fortune!” “Oh,” answered the peasant, “I will not have her, I have a wife already, and she is one too many for me; when I go home, it is just as bad as if I had a wife standing in every corner.” Then the King grew angry, and said, “Thou art a boor.” “Ah, Lord King,” replied the peasant, “what can you expect from an ox, but beef?” “Stop,” answered the King, you shall have another reward. Be off now, but come back in three days, and then you shall have five hundred counted out in full.” When the peasant went out by the gate, the sentry said, “You have made the King’s daughter laugh, so you will certainly receive something good.” “Yes, that is what I think,” answered the peasant; “five hundred are to be counted out to me.” “Hark you,” said the soldier, “give me some of it. What can you do with all that money?” “As it is you,” said the peasant, “you shall have two hundred; present yourself in three days’ time before the King, and let it be paid to you.” A Jew, who was standing by and had heard the conversation, ran after the peasant, held him by the coat, and said, “Oh, wonder! What a lucky child you are! I will change it for thee, I will change it for your into small coins, what do you want with the great big coins?” “Jew,” said the countryman, “three hundred can you still have; give it to me at once in coin, in three days from this, thou wilt be paid for it by the King.” The Jew was delighted with the profit, and brought the sum in bad groschen, three of which were worth two good ones. After three days had passed, according to the King’s command, the peasant went before the King. “Pull his coat off,” said the latter, “and he shall have his five hundred.” “Ah!” said the peasant, “they no longer belong to me; I presented two hundred of them to the sentinel, and three hundred the Jew has changed for me, so by right nothing at all belongs to me.” In the meantime the soldier and the Jew entered and claimed what they had gained from the peasant, and they received the blows strictly counted out. The soldier bore it patiently and knew already how it tasted; but the Jew said sorrowfully, “Alas, alas, are these the heavy coins?” The King could not help laughing at the peasant, and as all his anger was gone, he said, “As you have already lost your reward before it fell to you, I will give thee something in the place of it. Go into my treasure chamber and get some money for yourself, as much as you will.” The peasant did not need to be told twice, and stuffed into his big pockets whatsoever would go in. Afterwards he went to an inn and counted over his money. The Jew had crept after him and heard how he muttered to himself, “That rogue of a king has cheated me after all, why could he not have given me the money himself, and then I should have known what I had? How can I tell now if what I have had the luck to put in my pockets is right or not?” “Good heavens!” said the Jew to himself, “that man is speaking disrespectfully of our lord the King, I will run and inform, and then I shall get a reward, and he will be punished as well.” When the King heard of the peasant’s words he fell into a passion, and commanded the Jew to go and bring the offender to him. The Jew ran to the peasant, “You are to go at once to the lord King in the very clothes you have on.” “I know what’s right better than that,” answered the peasant, “I shall have a new coat made first. Do you think that a man with so much money in his pocket is to go there in his ragged old coat?” The Jew, as he saw that the peasant would not stir without another coat, and as he feared that if the King’s anger cooled, he himself would lose his reward, and the peasant his punishment, said, “I will out of pure friendship lend you a coat for the short time. What will people not do for love!” The peasant was contented with this, put the Jew’s coat on, and went off with him. The King reproached the countryman because of the evil speaking of which the Jew had informed him. “Ah,” said the peasant, “what a Jew says is always false no true word ever comes out of his mouth! That rascal there is capable of maintaining that I have his coat on.” “What is that?” shrieked the Jew. “Is the coat not mine? Have I not lent it to you out of pure friendship, in order that you might appear before the lord King?” When the King heard that, he said, “The Jew has assuredly deceived one or the other of us, either myself or the peasant,” and again he ordered something to be counted out to him in hard coins. The peasant, however, went home in the good coat, with the good money in his pocket, and said to himself, “This time I have hit it!”",Germany,,329.0,1714

The butcher thought it was a joke, but the peasant said, “Jesting apart, I will have my money! Did not the great dog bring you the whole of the slaughtered cow three days ago?” Then the butcher grew angry, snatched a broomstick and drove him out. “Wait a while,” said the peasant, “there is still some justice in the world!” and went to the royal palace and begged for an audience. He was led before the King, who sat there with his daughter, and asked him what injury he had suffered. “Alas!” said he, “the frogs and the dogs have taken from me what is mine, and the butcher has paid me for it with the stick,” and he related at full length all that had happened. Thereupon the King’s daughter began to laugh heartily, and the King said to him, “I cannot give you justice in this, but you shall have my daughter to wife for it, in her whole life she has never yet laughed as she has just done at you, and I have promised her to him who could make her laugh. You may thank God for your good fortune!” “Oh,” answered the peasant, “I will not have her, I have a wife already, and she is one too many for me; when I go home, it is just as bad as if I had a wife standing in every corner.” Then the King grew angry, and said, “Thou art a boor.” “Ah, Lord King,” replied the peasant, “what can you expect from an ox, but beef?” “Stop,” answered the King, you shall have another reward. Be off now, but come back in three days, and then you shall have five hundred counted out in full.” When the peasant went out by the gate, the sentry said, “You have made the King’s daughter laugh, so you will certainly receive something good.” “Yes, that is what I think,” answered the peasant; “five hundred are to be counted out to me.” “Hark you,” said the soldier, “give me some of it. What can you do with all that money?” “As it is you,” said the peasant, “you shall have two hundred; present yourself in three days’ time before the King, and let it be paid to you.” A Jew, who was standing by and had heard the conversation, ran after the peasant, held him by the coat, and said, “Oh, wonder! What a lucky child you are! I will change it for thee, I will change it for your into small coins, what do you want with the great big coins?” “Jew,” said the countryman, “three hundred can you still have; give it to me at once in coin, in three days from this, thou wilt be paid for it by the King.” The Jew was delighted with the profit, and brought the sum in bad groschen, three of which were worth two good ones. After three days had passed, according to the King’s command, the peasant went before the King. “Pull his coat off,” said the latter, “and he shall have his five hundred.” “Ah!” said the peasant, “they no longer belong to me; I presented two hundred of them to the sentinel, and three hundred the Jew has changed for me, so by right nothing at all belongs to me.” In the meantime the soldier and the Jew entered and claimed what they had gained from the peasant, and they received the blows strictly counted out. The soldier bore it patiently and knew already how it tasted; but the Jew said sorrowfully, “Alas, alas, are these the heavy coins?” The King could not help laughing at the peasant, and as all his anger was gone, he said, “As you have already lost your reward before it fell to you, I will give thee something in the place of it. Go into my treasure chamber and get some money for yourself, as much as you will.” The peasant did not need to be told twice, and stuffed into his big pockets whatsoever would go in. Afterwards he went to an inn and counted over his money. The Jew had crept after him and heard how he muttered to himself, “That rogue of a king has cheated me after all, why could he not have given me the money himself, and then I should have known what I had? How can I tell now if what I have had the luck to put in my pockets is right or not?” “Good heavens!” said the Jew to himself, “that man is speaking disrespectfully of our lord the King, I will run and inform, and then I shall get a reward, and he will be punished as well.” When the King heard of the peasant’s words he fell into a passion, and commanded the Jew to go and bring the offender to him. The Jew ran to the peasant, “You are to go at once to the lord King in the very clothes you have on.” “I know what’s right better than that,” answered the peasant, “I shall have a new coat made first. Do you think that a man with so much money in his pocket is to go there in his ragged old coat?” The Jew, as he saw that the peasant would not stir without another coat, and as he feared that if the King’s anger cooled, he himself would lose his reward, and the peasant his punishment, said, “I will out of pure friendship lend you a coat for the short time. What will people not do for love!” The peasant was contented with this, put the Jew’s coat on, and went off with him. The King reproached the countryman because of the evil speaking of which the Jew had informed him. “Ah,” said the peasant, “what a Jew says is always false no true word ever comes out of his mouth! That rascal there is capable of maintaining that I have his coat on.” “What is that?” shrieked the Jew. “Is the coat not mine? Have I not lent it to you out of pure friendship, in order that you might appear before the lord King?” When the King heard that, he said, “The Jew has assuredly deceived one or the other of us, either myself or the peasant,” and again he ordered something to be counted out to him in hard coins. The peasant, however, went home in the good coat, with the good money in his pocket, and said to himself, “This time I have hit it!”",Germany,,329.0,1714

But unhappily this man had a blue beard, which made him so ugly and so terrible that all the women and girls ran away from him. One of his neighbors, a lady of quality, had two daughters who were perfect beauties. He asked for one of them in marriage, leaving to her the choice of which she would bestow on him. They would neither of them have him, and they sent him backward and forward from one to the other, neither being able to make up her mind to marry a man who had a blue beard. Another thing which made them averse to him was that he had already married several wives, and nobody knew what had become of them. Blue Beard, to become better acquainted, took them, with their mother and three or four of their best friends, with some young people of the neighborhood to one of his country seats, where they stayed a whole week. There was nothing going on but pleasure parties, hunting, fishing, dancing, mirth, and feasting. Nobody went to bed, but all passed the night in playing pranks on each other. In short, everything succeeded so well that the youngest daughter began to think that the beard of the master of the house was not so very blue, and that he was a very civil gentleman. So as soon as they returned home, the marriage was concluded. About a month afterward Blue Beard told his wife that he was obliged to take a country journey for six weeks at least, upon business of great importance. He desired her to amuse herself well in his absence, to send for her friends, to take them into the country, if she pleased, and to live well wherever she was. “Here,” said he, “are the keys of the two great warehouses wherein I have my best furniture: these are of the room where I keep my silver and gold plate, which is not in everyday use; these open my safes, which hold my money, both gold and silver; these my caskets of jewels; and this is the master-key to all my apartments. But as for this little key, it is the key of the closet at the end of the great gallery on the ground floor. Open them all; go everywhere; but as for that little closet, I forbid you to enter it, and I promise you surely that, if you open it, there’s nothing that you may not expect from my anger.” She promised to obey exactly all his orders; and he, after having embraced her, got into his coach and proceeded on his journey. Her neighbors and good friends did not stay to be sent for by the new-married lady, so great was their impatience to see all the riches of her house, not daring to come while her husband was there, because of his blue beard, which frightened them. They at once ran through all the rooms, closets, and wardrobes, which were so fine and rich, and each seemed to surpass all others. They went up into the warehouses, where was the best and richest furniture; and they could not sufficiently admire the number and beauty of the tapestry, beds, couches, cabinets, stands, tables, and looking-glasses, in which you might see yourself from head to foot. Some of them were framed with glass, others with silver, plain and gilded, the most beautiful and the most magnificent ever seen. They ceased not to praise and envy the happiness of their friend, who, in the meantime, was not at all amused by looking upon all these rich things, because of her impatience to go and open the closet on the ground floor. Her curiosity was so great that, without considering how uncivil it was to leave her guests, she went down a little back staircase, with such excessive haste that twice or thrice she came near breaking her neck. Having reached the closet-door, she stood still for some time, thinking of her husband’s orders, and considering that unhappiness might attend her if she was disobedient; but the temptation was so strong she could not overcome it. She then took the little key, and opened the door, trembling. At first she could not see anything plainly, because the windows were shut. After some moments she began to perceive that several dead women were scattered about the floor. ( These were all the wives whom Blue Beard had married and murdered, one after the other, because they did not obey his orders about the closet on the ground floor.) She thought she surely would die for fear, and the key, which she pulled out of the lock, fell out of her hand. After having somewhat recovered from the shock, she picked up the key, locked the door, and went upstairs into her chamber to compose herself; but she could not rest, so much was she frightened. Having observed that the key of the closet was stained, she tried two or three times to wipe off the stain, but the stain would not come out. In vain did she wash it, and even rub it with soap and sand. The stain still remained, for the key was a magic key, and she could never make it quite clean; when the stain was gone off from one side, it came again on the other. Blue Beard returned from his journey that same evening, and said he had received letters upon the road, informing him that the business which called him away was ended to his advantage. His wife did all she could to convince him she was delighted at his speedy return. “The key Madam!” Illustration by John Austen. Published in Tales of Passed Times Written for Children. 1922. Selwyn & Blount, ltd. Next morning he asked her for the keys, which she gave him, but with such a trembling hand that he easily guessed what had happened. “How is it,” said he, “that the key of my closet is not among the rest?” “I must certainly,” said she, “have left it upstairs upon the table.” “Do not fail,” said Blue Beard, “to bring it to me presently.” After having put off doing it several times, she was forced to bring him the key. Blue Beard, having examined it, said to his wife:–“How comes this stain upon the key?” “I do not know,” cried the poor woman, paler than death. “You do not know!” replied Blue Beard. “I very well know. You wished to go into the cabinet? Very well, madam; you shall go in, and take your place among the ladies you saw there.” She threw herself weeping at her husband’s feet, and begged his pardon with all the signs of a true repentance for her disobedience. She would have melted a rock, so beautiful and sorrowful was she; but Blue Beard had a heart harder than any stone. “You must die, madam,” said he, “and that at once.” “Since I must die,” answered she, looking upon him with her eyes all bathed in tears, “give me some little time to say my prayers.” “I give you,” replied Blue Beard, “half a quarter of an hour, but not one moment more.” When she was alone she called out to her sister, and said to her:–“Sister Anne,”–for that was her name,–“go up, I beg you, to the top of the tower, and look if my brothers are not coming; they promised me they would come to-day, and if you see them, give them a sign to make haste.” Her sister Anne went up to the top of the tower, and the poor afflicted wife cried out from time to time:–“Anne, sister Anne, do you see any one coming?” And sister Anne said:–“I see nothing but the sun, which makes a dust, and the grass, which looks green.” In the meanwhile Blue Beard, holding a great sabre in his hand, cried to his wife as loud as he could:–“Come down instantly, or I shall come up to you.” “One moment longer, if you please,” said his wife; and then she cried out very softly, “Anne, sister Anne, dost thou see anybody coming?” And sister Anne answered:–“I see nothing but the sun, which makes a dust, and the grass, which is green.” “Come down quickly,” cried Blue Beard, “or I will come up to you.” “I am coming,” answered his wife; and then she cried, “Anne, sister Anne, dost thou not see any one coming?” “I see,” replied sister Anne, “a great dust, which comes from this side.” “Are they my brothers?” “Alas! no, my sister, I see a flock of sheep.” “Will you not come down?” cried Blue Beard. “One moment longer,” said his wife, and then she cried out, “Anne, sister Anne, dost thou see nobody coming?” “I see,” said she, “two horsemen, but they are yet a great way off.” “God be praised,” replied the poor wife, joyfully; “they are my brothers; I will make them a sign, as well as I can, for them to make haste.” Then Blue Beard bawled out so loud that he made the whole house tremble. The distressed wife came down and threw herself at his feet, all in tears, with her hair about her shoulders. “All this is of no help to you,” says Blue Beard: “you must die;” then, taking hold of her hair with one hand, and lifting up his sword in the air with the other, he was about to take off her head. The poor lady, turning about to him, and looking at him with dying eyes, desired him to afford her one little moment to her thoughts. “No, no,” said he, “commend thyself to God,” and again lifting his arm–At this moment there was such a loud knocking at the gate that Blue Beard stopped suddenly. The gate was opened, and presently entered two horsemen, who, with sword in hand, ran directly to Blue Beard. He knew them to be his wife’s brothers, one a dragoon, the other a musketeer. He ran away immediately, but the two brothers pursued him so closely that they overtook him before he could get to the steps of the porch. There they ran their swords through his body, and left him dead. The poor wife was almost as dead as her husband, and had not strength enough to arise and welcome her brothers. Blue Beard had no heirs, and so his wife became mistress of all his estate. She made use of one portion of it to marry her sister Anne to a young gentleman who had loved her a long while; another portion to buy captains’ commissions for her brothers; and the rest to marry herself to a very worthy gentleman, who made her forget the sorry time she had passed with Blue Beard.",France,,1679.0,1835

There they ran their swords through his body, and left him dead. The poor wife was almost as dead as her husband, and had not strength enough to arise and welcome her brothers. Blue Beard had no heirs, and so his wife became mistress of all his estate. She made use of one portion of it to marry her sister Anne to a young gentleman who had loved her a long while; another portion to buy captains’ commissions for her brothers; and the rest to marry herself to a very worthy gentleman, who made her forget the sorry time she had passed with Blue Beard.",France,,1679.0,1835

But unhappily this man had a blue beard, which made him so ugly and so terrible that all the women and girls ran away from him. One of his neighbors, a lady of quality, had two daughters who were perfect beauties. He asked for one of them in marriage, leaving to her the choice of which she would bestow on him. They would neither of them have him, and they sent him backward and forward from one to the other, neither being able to make up her mind to marry a man who had a blue beard. Another thing which made them averse to him was that he had already married several wives, and nobody knew what had become of them. Blue Beard, to become better acquainted, took them, with their mother and three or four of their best friends, with some young people of the neighborhood to one of his country seats, where they stayed a whole week. There was nothing going on but pleasure parties, hunting, fishing, dancing, mirth, and feasting. Nobody went to bed, but all passed the night in playing pranks on each other. In short, everything succeeded so well that the youngest daughter began to think that the beard of the master of the house was not so very blue, and that he was a very civil gentleman. So as soon as they returned home, the marriage was concluded. About a month afterward Blue Beard told his wife that he was obliged to take a country journey for six weeks at least, upon business of great importance. He desired her to amuse herself well in his absence, to send for her friends, to take them into the country, if she pleased, and to live well wherever she was. “Here,” said he, “are the keys of the two great warehouses wherein I have my best furniture: these are of the room where I keep my silver and gold plate, which is not in everyday use; these open my safes, which hold my money, both gold and silver; these my caskets of jewels; and this is the master-key to all my apartments. But as for this little key, it is the key of the closet at the end of the great gallery on the ground floor. Open them all; go everywhere; but as for that little closet, I forbid you to enter it, and I promise you surely that, if you open it, there’s nothing that you may not expect from my anger.” She promised to obey exactly all his orders; and he, after having embraced her, got into his coach and proceeded on his journey. Her neighbors and good friends did not stay to be sent for by the new-married lady, so great was their impatience to see all the riches of her house, not daring to come while her husband was there, because of his blue beard, which frightened them. They at once ran through all the rooms, closets, and wardrobes, which were so fine and rich, and each seemed to surpass all others. They went up into the warehouses, where was the best and richest furniture; and they could not sufficiently admire the number and beauty of the tapestry, beds, couches, cabinets, stands, tables, and looking-glasses, in which you might see yourself from head to foot. Some of them were framed with glass, others with silver, plain and gilded, the most beautiful and the most magnificent ever seen. They ceased not to praise and envy the happiness of their friend, who, in the meantime, was not at all amused by looking upon all these rich things, because of her impatience to go and open the closet on the ground floor. Her curiosity was so great that, without considering how uncivil it was to leave her guests, she went down a little back staircase, with such excessive haste that twice or thrice she came near breaking her neck. Having reached the closet-door, she stood still for some time, thinking of her husband’s orders, and considering that unhappiness might attend her if she was disobedient; but the temptation was so strong she could not overcome it. She then took the little key, and opened the door, trembling. At first she could not see anything plainly, because the windows were shut. After some moments she began to perceive that several dead women were scattered about the floor. ( These were all the wives whom Blue Beard had married and murdered, one after the other, because they did not obey his orders about the closet on the ground floor.) She thought she surely would die for fear, and the key, which she pulled out of the lock, fell out of her hand. After having somewhat recovered from the shock, she picked up the key, locked the door, and went upstairs into her chamber to compose herself; but she could not rest, so much was she frightened. Having observed that the key of the closet was stained, she tried two or three times to wipe off the stain, but the stain would not come out. In vain did she wash it, and even rub it with soap and sand. The stain still remained, for the key was a magic key, and she could never make it quite clean; when the stain was gone off from one side, it came again on the other. Blue Beard returned from his journey that same evening, and said he had received letters upon the road, informing him that the business which called him away was ended to his advantage. His wife did all she could to convince him she was delighted at his speedy return. “The key Madam!” Illustration by John Austen. Published in Tales of Passed Times Written for Children. 1922. Selwyn & Blount, ltd. Next morning he asked her for the keys, which she gave him, but with such a trembling hand that he easily guessed what had happened. “How is it,” said he, “that the key of my closet is not among the rest?” “I must certainly,” said she, “have left it upstairs upon the table.” “Do not fail,” said Blue Beard, “to bring it to me presently.” After having put off doing it several times, she was forced to bring him the key. Blue Beard, having examined it, said to his wife:–“How comes this stain upon the key?” “I do not know,” cried the poor woman, paler than death. “You do not know!” replied Blue Beard. “I very well know. You wished to go into the cabinet? Very well, madam; you shall go in, and take your place among the ladies you saw there.” She threw herself weeping at her husband’s feet, and begged his pardon with all the signs of a true repentance for her disobedience. She would have melted a rock, so beautiful and sorrowful was she; but Blue Beard had a heart harder than any stone. “You must die, madam,” said he, “and that at once.” “Since I must die,” answered she, looking upon him with her eyes all bathed in tears, “give me some little time to say my prayers.” “I give you,” replied Blue Beard, “half a quarter of an hour, but not one moment more.” When she was alone she called out to her sister, and said to her:–“Sister Anne,”–for that was her name,–“go up, I beg you, to the top of the tower, and look if my brothers are not coming; they promised me they would come to-day, and if you see them, give them a sign to make haste.” Her sister Anne went up to the top of the tower, and the poor afflicted wife cried out from time to time:–“Anne, sister Anne, do you see any one coming?” And sister Anne said:–“I see nothing but the sun, which makes a dust, and the grass, which looks green.” In the meanwhile Blue Beard, holding a great sabre in his hand, cried to his wife as loud as he could:–“Come down instantly, or I shall come up to you.” “One moment longer, if you please,” said his wife; and then she cried out very softly, “Anne, sister Anne, dost thou see anybody coming?” And sister Anne answered:–“I see nothing but the sun, which makes a dust, and the grass, which is green.” “Come down quickly,” cried Blue Beard, “or I will come up to you.” “I am coming,” answered his wife; and then she cried, “Anne, sister Anne, dost thou not see any one coming?” “I see,” replied sister Anne, “a great dust, which comes from this side.” “Are they my brothers?” “Alas! no, my sister, I see a flock of sheep.” “Will you not come down?” cried Blue Beard. “One moment longer,” said his wife, and then she cried out, “Anne, sister Anne, dost thou see nobody coming?” “I see,” said she, “two horsemen, but they are yet a great way off.” “God be praised,” replied the poor wife, joyfully; “they are my brothers; I will make them a sign, as well as I can, for them to make haste.” Then Blue Beard bawled out so loud that he made the whole house tremble. The distressed wife came down and threw herself at his feet, all in tears, with her hair about her shoulders. “All this is of no help to you,” says Blue Beard: “you must die;” then, taking hold of her hair with one hand, and lifting up his sword in the air with the other, he was about to take off her head. The poor lady, turning about to him, and looking at him with dying eyes, desired him to afford her one little moment to her thoughts. “No, no,” said he, “commend thyself to God,” and again lifting his arm–At this moment there was such a loud knocking at the gate that Blue Beard stopped suddenly. The gate was opened, and presently entered two horsemen, who, with sword in hand, ran directly to Blue Beard. He knew them to be his wife’s brothers, one a dragoon, the other a musketeer. He ran away immediately, but the two brothers pursued him so closely that they overtook him before he could get to the steps of the porch.

Its sand is yellow and fine, strewn with rose shells at the ebb tide. Its pine trees are ancient and they lean all one way, which is the way that the wild wind wills. Before Mio rolls the deep sea, and behind Mio rises Fugi, the most sacred, the mountain of mountains. Small marvel that the Strange People should come to Mio. Of the Strange People not much is known, even at Mio, though it is sure they come there. It seems they are shy indeed, more’s the pity. They come through the blue air, or across the mysterious paths of the sea. Their footprints are never, never seen upon the wet beach, for they tread too lightly. But sometimes in their dancing they sweep their robes upon the sand and leave it ribbed and ruffled; so, often enough, it may be seen at Mio. This is not all. Once a fisherman of Mio set eyes upon a maiden of the Strange People, and talked with her and made her do his bidding. This is a true thing, and thus it came about. The fisherman was out in his boat all night. He cast his net here and he cast his net there, but he caught nothing at all for his pains. It may be believed that he grew weary enough before the morning. In the cold of the dawn he brought his boat to shore and set foot on Mio Strand, shivering. Then, so he says, a warm wind met him and blew through his garments and his hair, so that he flushed and glowed. The very sand was full of comfort to his chilly feet. Upon the warm wind a fragrance was borne, cedar and vervain, and the scent of a hundred flowers. Flowers dropped softly through the air like bright rain. The fisherman stretched out his hands and caught them, lotus and jessamine and pomegranate. And all the while sweet music sounded. “This is never Mio Strand,” cried the fisherman, bewildered, “where I have pulled my boat ashore a thousand times or flown kites upon a holiday. Alack, I fear me I have sailed to the Fortunate Isles unawares, or come unwilling to the Sea King’s garden; or very like I am dead and never knew it, and this is Yomi. O Yomi, Land of Yomi, how like thou art to Mio Strand, my dear home!” After he had said this, the fisherman looked up the beach and down the beach, and he turned and saw Fuji, the mountain of mountains, and then he turned and saw the deep rolling sea and knew he was at Mio and no other place, and gave a long sigh. “Thanks be,” he said, and lifting his eyes he saw a robe of feathers hanging upon the branch of a pine tree. In the robe were feathers of all the birds that fly, every one; the kingfisher and the golden pheasant, the love bird, the swan, the crow, the cormorant, the dove, the bullfinch, the falcon, the plover, and the heron. “Ah, the pretty fluttering thing!” said the fisherman, and he took it from the pine tree where it hung. “Ah, the warm, sweet, fairy thing!” said the fisherman; “I’ll take it home for a treasure, sure no money could buy it, and I’ll show it to all the folk of the village.” And off he set for home with the fairy feathers over his arm. Now the maiden of the Strange People had been playing all this time with the White Children of the Foam that live in the salt sea. She looked up through the cold clear water and marked that her robe hung no longer on the pine-tree branch. “Alas, alas!” she cried, “my robe, my feather robe!” Swifter than any arrow she sprang from the water, and sped, fleet of foot, along the wet sand. The White Children of the Foam followed at her flashing heels. Clad in the cloak of her long hair, she came up with the fisherman. “Give me my feather robe,” she said, and held out her hand for it. “Why?” said the fisherman. “’Tis mine. I want it. I must have it.” “Oho,” said the fisherman, “finding’s keeping,” and he didn’t give her the feather robe. “I am a Fairy,” she said. “Farewell, Fairy,” said the fisherman. “A Moon Fairy,” she said. “Farewell, Moon Fairy,” said the fisherman, and he made to take his way along Mio Strand. At that she snatched at the feather robe, but the fisherman held fast. The feathers fluttered out and dropped upon the sand. “I wouldn’t do that,” said the fisherman. “You’ll have it all to pieces.” “I am a Moon Fairy, and at dawn I came to play upon fair Mio Strand; without my feathers I cannot go back to my place, my home in High Heaven. Therefore give me my feathers.” “No,” said the fisherman. “Oh, fisherman, fisherman, give me my robe.” “I couldn’t think of it,” said the fisherman. At this the maiden fell upon her knees and drooped like a lily in the heat of the day. With her arms she held the fisherman about the knees, and as she clung to him beseeching him, he felt her tears upon his bare feet. She wept and said: “I am a bird, a frail bird, A wounded bird with broken wings, I must die far from home, For the Five Woes are come upon me. The red flowers in my hair are faded; My robe is made unclean; Faintness comes upon me; I cannot see—farewell, dear sight of my eyes; I have lost joy. Oh, blessed flying clouds, and happy birds, And golden dust in the wind, And flying thoughts and flying prayers! I have lost all joy.” “Oh, stop,” said the fisherman, “you may have your robe.” “Give,” she cried. “Softly, softly,” said the fisherman. “Not so fast. I will give you your robe if you will dance for me here on Mio Strand.” “What must I dance?” she asked. “You must dance the mystic dance that makes the Palace of the Moon turn round.” She said, “Give me my feathers and I will dance it. I cannot dance without my feathers.” “What if you cheat me, what if you break your promise and fly immediately to the moon and no dancing at all?” “Ah, fisherman,” she said, “the faith of a Fairy!” Then he gave her the robe. Now, when she had arrayed herself and flung back her hair, the Fairy began to dance upon the yellow sand. In and out of the feather robe crept her fairy feet. Slowly, softly, she went with folded wings and sang: “Oh, the gold and silver mountains of the Moon, And the sweet Singing Birds of Heaven! They sing in the branches of the cinnamon tree, To entertain the thirty kings that are there. Fifteen kings in white garments, To reign for fifteen days. Fifteen kings in black garments, To reign for fifteen days. I hear the music of Heaven; Away, away, I fly to Fairy Places.” At this the Fairy spread her rainbow-coloured wings, and the wind that they made fluttered the red flowers in her hair. Out streamed the robe of feathers bright and gay. The Fairy laughed. Her feet touched the waves of the sea; her feet touched the grass and the flowers inshore. They touched the high branches of the pines and then the white clouds. “Farewell, fisherman!” the Fairy cried, and he saw her no more. Long, long he stood gazing up into the sky. At length he stooped and picked up a little feather from the shore, a grey dove’s feather. He smoothed it out with his finger and hid it in his girdle. Then he went to his home.",Japan,,784.0,1310

Therefore give me my feathers.” “No,” said the fisherman. “Oh, fisherman, fisherman, give me my robe.” “I couldn’t think of it,” said the fisherman. At this the maiden fell upon her knees and drooped like a lily in the heat of the day. With her arms she held the fisherman about the knees, and as she clung to him beseeching him, he felt her tears upon his bare feet. She wept and said: “I am a bird, a frail bird, A wounded bird with broken wings, I must die far from home, For the Five Woes are come upon me. The red flowers in my hair are faded; My robe is made unclean; Faintness comes upon me; I cannot see—farewell, dear sight of my eyes; I have lost joy. Oh, blessed flying clouds, and happy birds, And golden dust in the wind, And flying thoughts and flying prayers! I have lost all joy.” “Oh, stop,” said the fisherman, “you may have your robe.” “Give,” she cried. “Softly, softly,” said the fisherman. “Not so fast. I will give you your robe if you will dance for me here on Mio Strand.” “What must I dance?” she asked. “You must dance the mystic dance that makes the Palace of the Moon turn round.” She said, “Give me my feathers and I will dance it. I cannot dance without my feathers.” “What if you cheat me, what if you break your promise and fly immediately to the moon and no dancing at all?” “Ah, fisherman,” she said, “the faith of a Fairy!” Then he gave her the robe. Now, when she had arrayed herself and flung back her hair, the Fairy began to dance upon the yellow sand. In and out of the feather robe crept her fairy feet. Slowly, softly, she went with folded wings and sang: “Oh, the gold and silver mountains of the Moon, And the sweet Singing Birds of Heaven! They sing in the branches of the cinnamon tree, To entertain the thirty kings that are there. Fifteen kings in white garments, To reign for fifteen days. Fifteen kings in black garments, To reign for fifteen days. I hear the music of Heaven; Away, away, I fly to Fairy Places.” At this the Fairy spread her rainbow-coloured wings, and the wind that they made fluttered the red flowers in her hair. Out streamed the robe of feathers bright and gay. The Fairy laughed. Her feet touched the waves of the sea; her feet touched the grass and the flowers inshore. They touched the high branches of the pines and then the white clouds. “Farewell, fisherman!” the Fairy cried, and he saw her no more. Long, long he stood gazing up into the sky. At length he stooped and picked up a little feather from the shore, a grey dove’s feather. He smoothed it out with his finger and hid it in his girdle. Then he went to his home.",Japan,,784.0,1310

Its sand is yellow and fine, strewn with rose shells at the ebb tide. Its pine trees are ancient and they lean all one way, which is the way that the wild wind wills. Before Mio rolls the deep sea, and behind Mio rises Fugi, the most sacred, the mountain of mountains. Small marvel that the Strange People should come to Mio. Of the Strange People not much is known, even at Mio, though it is sure they come there. It seems they are shy indeed, more’s the pity. They come through the blue air, or across the mysterious paths of the sea. Their footprints are never, never seen upon the wet beach, for they tread too lightly. But sometimes in their dancing they sweep their robes upon the sand and leave it ribbed and ruffled; so, often enough, it may be seen at Mio. This is not all. Once a fisherman of Mio set eyes upon a maiden of the Strange People, and talked with her and made her do his bidding. This is a true thing, and thus it came about. The fisherman was out in his boat all night. He cast his net here and he cast his net there, but he caught nothing at all for his pains. It may be believed that he grew weary enough before the morning. In the cold of the dawn he brought his boat to shore and set foot on Mio Strand, shivering. Then, so he says, a warm wind met him and blew through his garments and his hair, so that he flushed and glowed. The very sand was full of comfort to his chilly feet. Upon the warm wind a fragrance was borne, cedar and vervain, and the scent of a hundred flowers. Flowers dropped softly through the air like bright rain. The fisherman stretched out his hands and caught them, lotus and jessamine and pomegranate. And all the while sweet music sounded. “This is never Mio Strand,” cried the fisherman, bewildered, “where I have pulled my boat ashore a thousand times or flown kites upon a holiday. Alack, I fear me I have sailed to the Fortunate Isles unawares, or come unwilling to the Sea King’s garden; or very like I am dead and never knew it, and this is Yomi. O Yomi, Land of Yomi, how like thou art to Mio Strand, my dear home!” After he had said this, the fisherman looked up the beach and down the beach, and he turned and saw Fuji, the mountain of mountains, and then he turned and saw the deep rolling sea and knew he was at Mio and no other place, and gave a long sigh. “Thanks be,” he said, and lifting his eyes he saw a robe of feathers hanging upon the branch of a pine tree. In the robe were feathers of all the birds that fly, every one; the kingfisher and the golden pheasant, the love bird, the swan, the crow, the cormorant, the dove, the bullfinch, the falcon, the plover, and the heron. “Ah, the pretty fluttering thing!” said the fisherman, and he took it from the pine tree where it hung. “Ah, the warm, sweet, fairy thing!” said the fisherman; “I’ll take it home for a treasure, sure no money could buy it, and I’ll show it to all the folk of the village.” And off he set for home with the fairy feathers over his arm. Now the maiden of the Strange People had been playing all this time with the White Children of the Foam that live in the salt sea. She looked up through the cold clear water and marked that her robe hung no longer on the pine-tree branch. “Alas, alas!” she cried, “my robe, my feather robe!” Swifter than any arrow she sprang from the water, and sped, fleet of foot, along the wet sand. The White Children of the Foam followed at her flashing heels. Clad in the cloak of her long hair, she came up with the fisherman. “Give me my feather robe,” she said, and held out her hand for it. “Why?” said the fisherman. “’Tis mine. I want it. I must have it.” “Oho,” said the fisherman, “finding’s keeping,” and he didn’t give her the feather robe. “I am a Fairy,” she said. “Farewell, Fairy,” said the fisherman. “A Moon Fairy,” she said. “Farewell, Moon Fairy,” said the fisherman, and he made to take his way along Mio Strand. At that she snatched at the feather robe, but the fisherman held fast. The feathers fluttered out and dropped upon the sand. “I wouldn’t do that,” said the fisherman. “You’ll have it all to pieces.” “I am a Moon Fairy, and at dawn I came to play upon fair Mio Strand; without my feathers I cannot go back to my place, my home in High Heaven. Therefore give me my feathers.” “No,” said the fisherman. “Oh, fisherman, fisherman, give me my robe.” “I couldn’t think of it,” said the fisherman.

With her arms she held the fisherman about the knees, and as she clung to him beseeching him, he felt her tears upon his bare feet. She wept and said: “I am a bird, a frail bird, A wounded bird with broken wings, I must die far from home, For the Five Woes are come upon me.

In that city reigned a king named Alakesa, who was a storehouse of all excellent qualities. He was so just a king that during his reign the cow and the tiger amicably quenched their thirst side by side in the same pond, the cats and the rats sported in one and the same spot, and the kite and the parrot laid their eggs in the same nest, as though they were “birds of a feather.” The women never deviated from the path of virtue, and regarded their husbands as gods. Timely rain refreshed the soil, and all Alakesa’s subjects lived in plenty and happiness. In short, Alakesa was the body, and his subjects the soul of that body, for he was upright in all things. Now there was in Alakapuri a rich merchant who lost a camel one day. He searched for it without success in all directions, and at last reached a road which he was informed led to another city, called Mathurapuri, the king of which was named Mathuresa. He had under him four excellent ministers, whose names were Bodhaditya, Bodhachandra, Bodhavyapaka, and Bodhavibhishana. These four ministers, being, for some reason, displeased with the king, quitted his dominions, and set out for another country. As they journeyed along they observed the track of a camel, and each made a remark on the peculiar condition of the animal, judging from the footsteps and other indications on the road. Presently they met the merchant who was searching for his camel, and, entering into conversation with him, one of the travellers inquired if the animal was not lame in one of its legs; another asked if it was not blind of the right eye; the third asked if its tail was not unusually short; and the fourth inquired if it was not suffering from colic. They were all answered in the affirmative by the merchant, who was convinced that they must have seen the animal, and eagerly demanded where they had seen it. They replied that they had seen traces of the camel, but not the camel itself, which being inconsistent with the minute description they had given of it, the merchant accused them of having stolen the beast, and immediately applied to king Alakesa for redress. On hearing the merchant’s story, the king was equally impressed with the belief that the travellers must know what had become of the camel, and sending for them threatened them with his displeasure if they did not confess the truth. How could they know, he demanded, that the camel was lame or blind, or whether the tail was long or short, or that it was suffering from any malady, unless they had it in their possession? In reply, they each explained the reasons which had induced them to express their belief in these particulars. The first traveller said:—“I noticed in the footmarks of the animal that one was deficient, and I concluded accordingly that it was lame of one of its legs.” The second said:—“I noticed that the leaves of the trees on the left side of the road had been snapped or torn off, whilst those on the right side were untouched, whence I concluded that the animal was blind of his right eye.” The third said:—“I saw some drops of blood on the road, which I conjectured had flowed from the bites of gnats or flies, and I thence concluded that the camel’s tail was shorter than usual, in consequence of which he could not brush the insects away.” The fourth said:—“I observed that while the forefeet of the animal were planted firmly on the ground the hind ones appeared to have scarcely touched it, whence I guessed that they were contracted by pain in the belly of the animal.” When the king heard their explanation he was much struck by the sagacity of the travellers, and giving 500 pagodas to the merchant who had lost the camel; he made the four young men his principal ministers, and bestowed on each of them several villages as free gifts.",India,,2475.0,700

He searched for it without success in all directions, and at last reached a road which he was informed led to another city, called Mathurapuri, the king of which was named Mathuresa. He had under him four excellent ministers, whose names were Bodhaditya, Bodhachandra, Bodhavyapaka, and Bodhavibhishana. These four ministers, being, for some reason, displeased with the king, quitted his dominions, and set out for another country. As they journeyed along they observed the track of a camel, and each made a remark on the peculiar condition of the animal, judging from the footsteps and other indications on the road. Presently they met the merchant who was searching for his camel, and, entering into conversation with him, one of the travellers inquired if the animal was not lame in one of its legs; another asked if it was not blind of the right eye; the third asked if its tail was not unusually short; and the fourth inquired if it was not suffering from colic. They were all answered in the affirmative by the merchant, who was convinced that they must have seen the animal, and eagerly demanded where they had seen it. They replied that they had seen traces of the camel, but not the camel itself, which being inconsistent with the minute description they had given of it, the merchant accused them of having stolen the beast, and immediately applied to king Alakesa for redress. On hearing the merchant’s story, the king was equally impressed with the belief that the travellers must know what had become of the camel, and sending for them threatened them with his displeasure if they did not confess the truth. How could they know, he demanded, that the camel was lame or blind, or whether the tail was long or short, or that it was suffering from any malady, unless they had it in their possession? In reply, they each explained the reasons which had induced them to express their belief in these particulars. The first traveller said:—“I noticed in the footmarks of the animal that one was deficient, and I concluded accordingly that it was lame of one of its legs.” The second said:—“I noticed that the leaves of the trees on the left side of the road had been snapped or torn off, whilst those on the right side were untouched, whence I concluded that the animal was blind of his right eye.” The third said:—“I saw some drops of blood on the road, which I conjectured had flowed from the bites of gnats or flies, and I thence concluded that the camel’s tail was shorter than usual, in consequence of which he could not brush the insects away.” The fourth said:—“I observed that while the forefeet of the animal were planted firmly on the ground the hind ones appeared to have scarcely touched it, whence I guessed that they were contracted by pain in the belly of the animal.” When the king heard their explanation he was much struck by the sagacity of the travellers, and giving 500 pagodas to the merchant who had lost the camel; he made the four young men his principal ministers, and bestowed on each of them several villages as free gifts.",India,,2475.0,700

Then Saint Peter came with the key, and opened the door, and let the great man in, but apparently did not see the peasant, and shut the door again. And now the peasant outside, heard how the great man was received in heaven with all kinds of rejoicing, and how they were making music, and singing within. At length all became quiet again, and Saint Peter came and opened the gate of heaven, and let the peasant in. The peasant, however, expected that they would make music and sing when he went in also, but all remained quite quiet; he was received with great affection, it is true, and the angels came to meet him, but no one sang. Then the peasant asked Saint Peter how it was that they did not sing for him as they had done when the rich man went in, and said that it seemed to him that there in heaven things were done with just as much partiality as on earth. Then said Saint Peter, “By no means, thou art just as dear to us as any one else, and wilt enjoy every heavenly delight that the rich man enjoys, but poor fellows like thee come to heaven every day, but a rich man like this does not come more than once in a hundred years!”",Germany,,12.0,256

They were great black creatures that ran boldly in broad daylight through the streets, and swarmed so, all over the houses, that people at last could not put their hand or foot down anywhere without touching one. When dressing in the morning they found them in their breeches and petticoats, in their pockets and in their boots; and when they wanted a morsel to eat, the voracious horde had swept away everything from cellar to garret. The night was even worse. As soon as the lights were out, these untiring nibblers set to work. And everywhere, in the ceilings, in the floors, in the cupboards, at the doors, there was a chase and a rummage, and so furious a noise of gimlets, pincers, and saws, that a deaf man could not have rested for one hour together. Neither cats nor dogs, nor poison nor traps, nor prayers nor candles burnt to all the saints–nothing would do anything. The more they killed the more came. And the inhabitants of Hamel began to go to the dogs ( not that THEY were of much use), when one Friday there arrived in the town a man with a queer face, who played the bagpipes and sang this refrain:` Qui vivra verra: Le voila, Le preneur des rats.’He was a great gawky fellow, dry and bronzed, with a crooked nose, a long rat-tail moustache, two great yellow piercing and mocking eyes, under a large felt hat set off by a scarlet cock’s feather. He was dressed in a green jacket with a leather belt and red breeches, and on his feet were sandals fastened by thongs passed round his legs in the gipsy fashion. That is how he may be seen to this day, painted on a window of the cathedral of Hamel. He stopped on the great market-place before the town hall, turned his back on the church and went on with his music, singing:` Who lives shall see: This is he, The ratcatcher.’The town council had just assembled to consider once more this plague of Egypt, from which no one could save the town. The stranger sent word to the counsellors that, if they would make it worth his while, he would rid them of all their rats before night, down to the very last.` Then he is a sorcerer!’ cried the citizens with one voice; ` we must beware of him.’The Town Counsellor, who was considered clever, reassured them. He said: ` Sorcerer or no, if this bagpiper speaks the truth, it was he who sent us this horrible vermin that he wants to rid us of to-day for money. Well, we must learn to catch the devil in his own snares. You leave it to me.’` Leave it to the Town Counsellor,’ said the citizens one to another. And the stranger was brought before them.` Before night,’ said he, ` I shall have despatched all the rats in Hamel if you will but pay me a gros a head.’` A gros a head!’ cried the citizens, ` but that will come to millions of florins!’The Town Counsellor simply shrugged his shoulders and said to the stranger:` A bargain! To work; the rats will be paid one gros a head as you ask.’The bagpiper announced that he would operate that very evening when the moon rose. He added that the inhabitants should at that hour leave the streets free, and content themselves with looking out of their windows at what was passing, and that it would be a pleasant spectacle. When the people of Hamel heard of the bargain, they too exclaimed: ` A gros a head! but this will cost us a deal of money!’` Leave it to the Town Counsellor,’ said the town council with a malicious air. And the good people of Hamel repeated with their counsellors, ` Leave it to the Town Counsellor.’Towards nine at night the bagpiper re-appeared on the market place. He turned, as at first, his back to the church, and the moment the moon rose on the horizon, ` Trarira, trari!’ the bagpipes resounded. It was first a slow, caressing sound, then more and more lively and urgent, and so sonorous and piercing that it penetrated as far as the farthest alleys and retreats of the town. Soon from the bottom of the cellars, the top of the garrets, from under all the furniture, from all the nooks and corners of the houses, out come the rats, search for the door, fling themselves into the street, and trip, trip, trip, begin to run in file towards the front of the town hall, so squeezed together that they covered the pavement like the waves of flooded torrent. When the square was quite full the bagpiper faced about, and, still playing briskly, turned towards the river that runs at the foot of the walls of Hamel. Arrived there he turned round; the rats were following.` Hop! hop!’ he cried, pointing with his finger to the middle of the stream, where the water whirled and was drawn down as if through a funnel. And hop! hop! without hesitating, the rats took the leap, swam straight to the funnel, plunged in head foremost and disappeared. The plunging continued thus without ceasing till midnight. At last, dragging himself with difficulty, came a big rat, white with age, and stopped on the bank. It was the king of the band.` Are they all there, friend Blanchet?’ asked the bagpiper.` They are all there,’ replied friend Blanchet.` And how many were they?’` Nine hundred and ninety thousand, nine hundred and ninety- nine.’` Well reckoned?’` Well reckoned.’` Then go and join them, old sire, and au revoir.’Then the old white rat sprang in his turn into the river, swam to the whirlpool and disappeared. When the bagpiper had thus concluded his business he went to bed at his inn. And for the first time during three months the people of Hamel slept quietly through the night. The next morning, at nine o’clock, the bagpiper repaired to the town hall, where the town council awaited him.` All your rats took a jump into the river yesterday,’ said he to the counsellors, ` and I guarantee that not one of them comes back. They were nine hundred and ninety thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine, at one gros a head. Reckon!’` Let us reckon the heads first. One gros a head is one head the gros. Where are the heads?’The ratcatcher did not expect this treacherous stroke. He paled with anger and his eyes flashed fire.` The heads!’ cried he, ` if you care about them, go and find them in the river.’` So,’ replied the Town Counsellor, ` you refuse to hold to the terms of your agreement? We ourselves could refuse you all payment. But you have been of use to us, and we will not let you go without a recompense,’ and he offered him fifty crowns.` Keep your recompense for yourself,’ replied the ratcatcher proudly. ` If you do not pay me I will be paid by your heirs.’Thereupon he pulled his hat down over his eyes, went hastily out of the hall, and left the town without speaking to a soul. When the Hamel people heard how the affair had ended they rubbed their hands, and with no more scruple than their Town Counsellor, they laughed over the ratcatcher, who, they said, was caught in his own trap. But what made them laugh above all was his threat of getting himself paid by their heirs. Ha! they wished that they only had such creditors for the rest of their lives. Next day, which was a Sunday, they all went gaily to church, thinking that after Mass they would at last be able to eat some good thing that the rats had not tasted before them. They never suspected the terrible surprise that awaited them on their return home. No children anywhere, they had all disappeared!` Our children! where are our poor children?’ was the cry that was soon heard in all the streets. Then through the east door of the town came three little boys, who cried and wept, and this is what they told: While the parents were at church a wonderful music had resounded. Soon all the little boys and all the little girls that had been left at home had gone out, attracted by the magic sounds, and had rushed to the great market-place. There they found the ratcatcher playing his bagpipes at the same spot as the evening before. Then the stranger had begun to walk quickly, and they had followed, running, singing and dancing to the sound of the music, as far as the foot of the mountain which one sees on entering Hamel. At their approach the mountain had opened a little, and the bagpiper had gone in with them, after which it had closed again. Only the three little ones who told the adventure had remained outside, as if by a miracle. One was bandy-legged and could not run fast enough; the other, who had left the house in haste, one foot shod the other bare, had hurt himself against a big stone and could not walk without difficulty; the third had arrived in time, but in harrying to go in with the others had struck so violently against the wall of the mountain that he fell backwards at the moment it closed upon his comrades. At this story the parents redoubled their lamentations. They ran with pikes and mattocks to the mountain, and searched till evening to find the opening by which their children had disappeared, without being able to find it. At last, the night falling, they returned desolate to Hamel. But the most unhappy of all was the Town Counsellor, for he lost three little boys and two pretty little girls, and to crown all, the people of Hamel overwhelmed him with reproaches, forgetting that the evening before they had all agreed with him. What had become of all these unfortunate children? The parents always hoped they were not dead, and that the rat- catcher, who certainly must have come out of the mountain, would have taken them with him to his country. That is why for several years they sent in search of them to different countries, but no one ever came on the trace of the poor little ones. It was not till much later that anything was to be heard of them. About one hundred and fifty years after the event, when there was no longer one left of the fathers, mothers, brothers or sisters of that day, there arrived one evening in Hamel some merchants of Bremen returning from the East, who asked to speak with the citizens. They told that they, in crossing Hungary, had sojourned in a mountainous country called Transylvania, where the inhabitants only spoke German, while all around them nothing was spoken but Hungarian. These people also declared that they came from Germany, but they did not know how they chanced to be in this strange country. ` Now,’ said the merchants of Bremen, ` these Germans cannot be other than the descendants of the lost children of Hamel.’The people of Hamel did not doubt it; and since that day they regard it as certain that the Transylvanians of Hungary are their country folk, whose ancestors, as children, were brought there by the ratcatcher. There are more difficult things to believe than that.",France,,930.0,1943

They were great black creatures that ran boldly in broad daylight through the streets, and swarmed so, all over the houses, that people at last could not put their hand or foot down anywhere without touching one. When dressing in the morning they found them in their breeches and petticoats, in their pockets and in their boots; and when they wanted a morsel to eat, the voracious horde had swept away everything from cellar to garret. The night was even worse. As soon as the lights were out, these untiring nibblers set to work. And everywhere, in the ceilings, in the floors, in the cupboards, at the doors, there was a chase and a rummage, and so furious a noise of gimlets, pincers, and saws, that a deaf man could not have rested for one hour together. Neither cats nor dogs, nor poison nor traps, nor prayers nor candles burnt to all the saints–nothing would do anything. The more they killed the more came. And the inhabitants of Hamel began to go to the dogs ( not that THEY were of much use), when one Friday there arrived in the town a man with a queer face, who played the bagpipes and sang this refrain:` Qui vivra verra: Le voila, Le preneur des rats.’He was a great gawky fellow, dry and bronzed, with a crooked nose, a long rat-tail moustache, two great yellow piercing and mocking eyes, under a large felt hat set off by a scarlet cock’s feather. He was dressed in a green jacket with a leather belt and red breeches, and on his feet were sandals fastened by thongs passed round his legs in the gipsy fashion. That is how he may be seen to this day, painted on a window of the cathedral of Hamel. He stopped on the great market-place before the town hall, turned his back on the church and went on with his music, singing:` Who lives shall see: This is he, The ratcatcher.’The town council had just assembled to consider once more this plague of Egypt, from which no one could save the town. The stranger sent word to the counsellors that, if they would make it worth his while, he would rid them of all their rats before night, down to the very last.` Then he is a sorcerer!’ cried the citizens with one voice; ` we must beware of him.’The Town Counsellor, who was considered clever, reassured them. He said: ` Sorcerer or no, if this bagpiper speaks the truth, it was he who sent us this horrible vermin that he wants to rid us of to-day for money. Well, we must learn to catch the devil in his own snares. You leave it to me.’` Leave it to the Town Counsellor,’ said the citizens one to another. And the stranger was brought before them.` Before night,’ said he, ` I shall have despatched all the rats in Hamel if you will but pay me a gros a head.’` A gros a head!’ cried the citizens, ` but that will come to millions of florins!’The Town Counsellor simply shrugged his shoulders and said to the stranger:` A bargain! To work; the rats will be paid one gros a head as you ask.’The bagpiper announced that he would operate that very evening when the moon rose. He added that the inhabitants should at that hour leave the streets free, and content themselves with looking out of their windows at what was passing, and that it would be a pleasant spectacle. When the people of Hamel heard of the bargain, they too exclaimed: ` A gros a head! but this will cost us a deal of money!’` Leave it to the Town Counsellor,’ said the town council with a malicious air. And the good people of Hamel repeated with their counsellors, ` Leave it to the Town Counsellor.’Towards nine at night the bagpiper re-appeared on the market place. He turned, as at first, his back to the church, and the moment the moon rose on the horizon, ` Trarira, trari!’ the bagpipes resounded. It was first a slow, caressing sound, then more and more lively and urgent, and so sonorous and piercing that it penetrated as far as the farthest alleys and retreats of the town. Soon from the bottom of the cellars, the top of the garrets, from under all the furniture, from all the nooks and corners of the houses, out come the rats, search for the door, fling themselves into the street, and trip, trip, trip, begin to run in file towards the front of the town hall, so squeezed together that they covered the pavement like the waves of flooded torrent. When the square was quite full the bagpiper faced about, and, still playing briskly, turned towards the river that runs at the foot of the walls of Hamel. Arrived there he turned round; the rats were following.` Hop! hop!’ he cried, pointing with his finger to the middle of the stream, where the water whirled and was drawn down as if through a funnel. And hop! hop! without hesitating, the rats took the leap, swam straight to the funnel, plunged in head foremost and disappeared. The plunging continued thus without ceasing till midnight. At last, dragging himself with difficulty, came a big rat, white with age, and stopped on the bank. It was the king of the band.` Are they all there, friend Blanchet?’ asked the bagpiper.` They are all there,’ replied friend Blanchet.` And how many were they?’` Nine hundred and ninety thousand, nine hundred and ninety- nine.’` Well reckoned?’` Well reckoned.’` Then go and join them, old sire, and au revoir.’Then the old white rat sprang in his turn into the river, swam to the whirlpool and disappeared. When the bagpiper had thus concluded his business he went to bed at his inn. And for the first time during three months the people of Hamel slept quietly through the night. The next morning, at nine o’clock, the bagpiper repaired to the town hall, where the town council awaited him.` All your rats took a jump into the river yesterday,’ said he to the counsellors, ` and I guarantee that not one of them comes back.

No one knew whither he carried them, for they were never seen more. One day he appeared before the door of a man who had three pretty daughters; he looked like a poor weak beggar, and carried a basket on his back, as if he meant to collect charitable gifts in it. He begged for a little food, and when the eldest daughter came out and was just reaching him a piece of bread, he did but touch her, and she was forced to jump into his basket. Thereupon he hurried away with long strides, and carried her away into a dark forest to his house, which stood in the midst of it. Everything in the house was magnificent; he gave her whatsoever she could possibly desire, and said, “My darling, you will certainly be happy with me, for you have everything your heart can wish for.” This lasted a few days, and then he said, “I must journey forth, and leave you alone for a short time; there are the keys of the house; you may go everywhere and look at everything except into one room, which this little key here opens, and there I forbid you to go on pain of death.” He likewise gave her an egg and said, “Preserve the egg carefully for me, and carry it continually about with you, for a great misfortune would arise from the loss of it.” She took the keys and the egg, and promised to obey him in everything. When he was gone, she went all round the house from the bottom to the top, and examined everything. The rooms shone with silver and gold, and she thought she had never seen such great splendour. At length she came to the forbidden door; she wished to pass it by, but curiosity let her have no rest. She examined the key, it looked just like any other; she put it in the keyhole and turned it a little, and the door sprang open. But what did she see when she went in? A great bloody basin stood in the middle of the room, and therein lay human beings, dead and hewn to pieces, and hard by was a block of wood, and a gleaming axe lay upon it. She was so terribly alarmed that the egg which she held in her hand fell into the basin. She got it out and washed the blood off, but in vain, it appeared again in a moment. She washed and scrubbed, but she could not get it out. It was not long before the man came back from his journey, and the first things which he asked for were the key and the egg. She gave them to him, but she trembled as she did so, and he saw at once by the red spots that she had been in the bloody chamber. “Since you have gone into the room against my will,” said he, “you shall go back into it against your own. Your life is ended.” He threw her down, dragged her there by her hair, cut her head off on the block, and hewed her in pieces so that her blood ran on the ground. Then he threw her into the basin with the rest. “Now I will fetch myself the second,” said the wizard, and again he went to the house in the shape of a poor man, and begged. Then the second daughter brought him a piece of bread; he caught her like the first, by simply touching her, and carried her away. She did not fare better than her sister. She allowed herself to be led away by her curiosity, opened the door of the bloody chamber, looked in, and had to atone for it with her life on the wizard’s return. Then he went and brought the third sister, but she was clever and crafty. When he had given her the keys and the egg, and had left her, she first put the egg away with great care, and then she examined the house, and at last went into the forbidden room. Alas, what did she behold! Both her sisters lay there in the basin, cruelly murdered, and cut in pieces. But she began to gather their limbs together and put them in order, head, body, arms and legs. And when nothing further was wanting the limbs began to move and unite themselves together, and both the maidens opened their eyes and were once more alive. Then they rejoiced and kissed and caressed each other. On his arrival, the man at once demanded the keys and the egg, and as he could perceive no trace of any blood on it, he said, “You have stood the test, you shall be my bride.” He now had no longer any power over her, and was forced to do whatsoever she desired. “Oh, very well,” said she, “you shall first take a basketful of gold to my father and mother, and carry it yourself on thy back; in the meantime I will prepare for the wedding.” Then she ran to her sisters, whom she had hidden in a little chamber and said, “The moment has come when I can save you. The wretch shall himself carry you home again, but as soon as you are at home send help to me.” She put both of them in a basket and covered them quite over with gold, so that nothing of them was to be seen, then she called in the wizard and said to him, “Now carry the basket away, but I shall look through my little window and watch to see if you stop on the way to stand or to rest.” The wizard raised the basket on his back and went away with it, but it weighed him down so heavily that the perspiration streamed from his face. Then he sat down and wanted to rest awhile, but immediately one of the girls in the basket cried, “I am looking through my little window, and I see that you are resting. Will you go on at once?” He thought his bride was calling that to him; and got up on his legs again. Once more he was going to sit down, but instantly she cried, “I am looking through my little window, and I see that you are resting. Will you go on directly?” And whenever he stood still, she cried this, and then he was forced to go onwards, until at last, groaning and out of breath, he took the basket with the gold and the two maidens into their parents’ house. At home, however, the bride prepared the marriage-feast, and sent invitations to the friends of the wizard. Then she took a skull with grinning teeth, put some ornaments on it and a wreath of flowers, carried it upstairs to the garret-window, and let it look out from there. When all was ready, she got into a barrel of honey, and then cut the feather-bed open and rolled herself in it, until she looked like a wondrous bird, and no one could recognize her. Then she went out of the house, and on her way she met some of the wedding-guests, who asked, “O, Fitcher’s bird, how com’st you here?” “I come from Fitcher’s house quite near.” “And what may the young bride be doing?” “From cellar to garret she’s swept all clean, And now from the window she’s peeping, I’ve seen.” At last she met the bridegroom, who was coming slowly back. He, like the others, asked, “O, Fitcher’s bird, how com’st thou here?” “I come from Fitcher’s house quite near.” “And what may the young bride be doing? “From cellar to garret she’s swept all clean, And now from the window she’s peeping, I’ve seen.” The bridegroom looked up, saw the decked-out skull, thought it was his bride, and nodded to her, greeting her kindly. But when he and his guests had all gone into the house, the brothers and kinsmen of the bride, who had been sent to rescue her, arrived. They locked all the doors of the house, that no one might escape, set fire to it, and the wizard and all his crew had to burn.",Germany,,2185.0,1401

But when he and his guests had all gone into the house, the brothers and kinsmen of the bride, who had been sent to rescue her, arrived. They locked all the doors of the house, that no one might escape, set fire to it, and the wizard and all his crew had to burn.",Germany,,2185.0,1401

When he was on his death-bed he turned to them and said, ‘I have nothing to leave you but three sheep and a small house; divide them between you, as you like, but don’t quarrel over them whatever you do.’When the shepherd was dead, the brother asked his sister which she would like best, the sheep or the little house; and when she had chosen the house he said, ‘Then I’ll take the sheep and go out to seek my fortune in the wide world. I don’t see why I shouldn’t be as lucky as many another who has set out on the same search, and it wasn’t for nothing that I was born on a Sunday.’{ Listen to The Three Dogs plus hundreds of other fairy tale audiobooks in the Fairytalez Audio Book App for Apple and Android devices} And so he started on his travels, driving his three sheep in front of him, and for a long time it seemed as if fortune didn’t mean to favour him at all. One day he was sitting disconsolately at a cross road, when a man suddenly appeared before him with three black dogs, each one bigger than the other. ‘Hullo, my fine fellow,’ said the man, ‘I see you have three fat sheep. I’ll tell you what; if you’ll give them to me, I’ll give you my three dogs.’In spite of his sadness, the youth smiled and replied, ‘What would I do with your dogs? My sheep at least feed themselves, but I should have to find food for the dogs.’‘My dogs are not like other dogs,’ said the stranger; ‘they will feed you instead of you them, and will make your fortune. The smallest one is called “Salt,” and will bring you food whenever you wish; the second is called “Pepper,” and will tear anyone to pieces who offers to hurt you; and the great big strong one is called “Mustard,” and is so powerful that it will break iron or steel with its teeth.’The shepherd at last let himself be persuaded, and gave the stranger his sheep. In order to test the truth of his statement about the dogs, he said at once, ‘Salt, I am hungry,’ and before the words were out of his mouth the dog had disappeared, and returned in a few minutes with a large basket full of the most delicious food. Then the youth congratulated himself on the bargain he had made, and continued his journey in the best of spirits. One day he met a carriage and pair, all draped in black; even the horses were covered with black trappings, and the coachman was clothed in crape from top to toe. Inside the carriage sat a beautiful girl in a black dress crying bitterly. The horses advanced slowly and mournfully, with their heads bent on the ground. ‘Coachman, what’s the meaning of all this grief?’ asked the shepherd. At first the coachman wouldn’t say anything, but when the youth pressed him he told him that a huge dragon dwelt in the neighbourhood, and required yearly the sacrifice of a beautiful maiden. This year the lot had fallen on the King’s daughter, and the whole country was filled with woe and lamentation in consequence. The shepherd felt very sorry for the lovely maiden, and determined to follow the carriage. In a little it halted at the foot of a high mountain. The girl got out, and walked slowly and sadly to meet her terrible fate. The coachman perceived that the shepherd wished to follow her, and warned him not to do so if he valued his life; but the shepherd wouldn’t listen to his advice. When they had climbed about half-way up the hill they saw a terrible-looking monster with the body of a snake, and with huge wings and claws, coming towards them, breathing forth flames of fire, and preparing to seize its victim. Then the shepherd called, ‘Pepper, come to the rescue,’ and the second dog set upon the dragon, and after a fierce struggle bit it so sharply in the neck that the monster rolled over, and in a few moments breathed its last. Then the dog ate up the body, all except its two front teeth, which the shepherd picked up and put in his pocket. The Princess was quite overcome with terror and joy, and fell fainting at the feet of her deliverer. When she recovered her consciousness she begged the shepherd to return with her to her father, who would reward him richly. But the youth answered that he wanted to see something of the world, and that he would return again in three years, and nothing would make him change this resolve. The Princess seated herself once more in her carriage, and, bidding each other farewell, she and the shepherd separated, she to return home, and he to see the world. But while the Princess was driving over a bridge the carriage suddenly stood still, and the coachman turned round to her and said, ‘Your deliverer has gone, and doesn’t thank you for your gratitude. It would be nice of you to make a poor fellow happy; therefore you may tell your father that it was I who slew the dragon, and if you refuse to, I will throw you into the river, and no one will be any the wiser, for they will think the dragon has devoured you.’The maiden was in a dreadful state when she heard these words; but there was nothing for her to do but to swear that she would give out the coachman as her deliverer, and not to divulge the secret to anyone. So they returned to the capital, and everyone was delighted when they saw the Princess had returned unharmed; the black flags were taken down from all the palace towers, and gay- coloured ones put up in their place, and the King embraced his daughter and her supposed rescuer with tears of joy, and, turning to the coachman, he said, ‘You have not only saved the life of my child, but you have also freed the country from a terrible scourge; therefore, it is only fitting that you should be richly rewarded. Take, therefore, my daughter for your wife; but as she is still so young, do not let the marriage be celebrated for another year.’The coachman thanked the King for his graciousness, and was then led away to be richly dressed and instructed in all the arts and graces that befitted his new position. But the poor Princess wept bitterly, though she did not dare to confide her grief to anyone. When the year was over, she begged so hard for another year’s respite that it was granted to her. But this year passed also, and she threw herself at her father’s feet, and begged so piteously for one more year that the King’s heart was melted, and he yielded to her request, much to the Princess’s joy, for she knew that her real deliverer would appear at the end of the third year. And so the year passed away like the other two, and the wedding-day was fixed, and all the people were prepared to feast and make merry. But on the wedding-day it happened that a stranger came to the town with three black dogs. He asked what the meaning of all the feasting and fuss was, and they told him that the King’s daughter was just going to be married to the man who had slain the terrible dragon. The stranger at once denounced the coachman as a liar; but no one would listen to him, and he was seized and thrown into a cell with iron doors. While he was lying on his straw pallet, pondering mournfully on his fate, he thought he heard the low whining of his dogs outside; then an idea dawned on him, and he called out as loudly as he could, ‘Mustard, come to my help,’ and in a second he saw the paws of his biggest dog at the window of his cell, and before he could count two the creature had bitten through the iron bars and stood beside him. Then they both let themselves out of the prison by the window, and the poor youth was free once more, though he felt very sad when he thought that another was to enjoy the reward that rightfully belonged to him. He felt hungry too, so he called his dog ‘Salt,’ and asked him to bring home some food. The faithful creature trotted off, and soon returned with a table-napkin full of the most delicious food, and the napkin itself was embroidered with a kingly crown. The King had just seated himself at the wedding-feast with all his Court, when the dog appeared and licked the Princess’s hand in an appealing manner. With a joyful start she recognised the beast, and bound her own table-napkin round his neck. Then she plucked up her courage and told her father the whole story. The King at once sent a servant to follow the dog, and in a short time the stranger was led into the Kings presence. The former coachman grew as white as a sheet when he saw the shepherd, and, falling on his knees, begged for mercy and pardon. The Princess recognized her deliverer at once, and did not need the proof of the two dragon’s teeth which he drew from his pocket. The coachman was thrown into a dark dungeon, and the shepherd took his place at the Princess’s side, and this time, you may be sure, she did not beg for the wedding to be put off. The young couple lived for some time in great peace and happiness, when suddenly one day the former shepherd bethought himself of his poor sister and expressed a wish to see her again, and to let her share in his good fortune. So they sent a carriage to fetch her, and soon she arrived at the court, and found herself once more in her brother’s arms. Then one of the dogs spoke and said, ‘Our task is done; you have no more need of us.

When he was on his death-bed he turned to them and said, ‘I have nothing to leave you but three sheep and a small house; divide them between you, as you like, but don’t quarrel over them whatever you do.’When the shepherd was dead, the brother asked his sister which she would like best, the sheep or the little house; and when she had chosen the house he said, ‘Then I’ll take the sheep and go out to seek my fortune in the wide world. I don’t see why I shouldn’t be as lucky as many another who has set out on the same search, and it wasn’t for nothing that I was born on a Sunday.’{ Listen to The Three Dogs plus hundreds of other fairy tale audiobooks in the Fairytalez Audio Book App for Apple and Android devices} And so he started on his travels, driving his three sheep in front of him, and for a long time it seemed as if fortune didn’t mean to favour him at all. One day he was sitting disconsolately at a cross road, when a man suddenly appeared before him with three black dogs, each one bigger than the other. ‘Hullo, my fine fellow,’ said the man, ‘I see you have three fat sheep. I’ll tell you what; if you’ll give them to me, I’ll give you my three dogs.’In spite of his sadness, the youth smiled and replied, ‘What would I do with your dogs? My sheep at least feed themselves, but I should have to find food for the dogs.’‘My dogs are not like other dogs,’ said the stranger; ‘they will feed you instead of you them, and will make your fortune. The smallest one is called “Salt,” and will bring you food whenever you wish; the second is called “Pepper,” and will tear anyone to pieces who offers to hurt you; and the great big strong one is called “Mustard,” and is so powerful that it will break iron or steel with its teeth.’The shepherd at last let himself be persuaded, and gave the stranger his sheep. In order to test the truth of his statement about the dogs, he said at once, ‘Salt, I am hungry,’ and before the words were out of his mouth the dog had disappeared, and returned in a few minutes with a large basket full of the most delicious food. Then the youth congratulated himself on the bargain he had made, and continued his journey in the best of spirits. One day he met a carriage and pair, all draped in black; even the horses were covered with black trappings, and the coachman was clothed in crape from top to toe. Inside the carriage sat a beautiful girl in a black dress crying bitterly. The horses advanced slowly and mournfully, with their heads bent on the ground. ‘Coachman, what’s the meaning of all this grief?’ asked the shepherd. At first the coachman wouldn’t say anything, but when the youth pressed him he told him that a huge dragon dwelt in the neighbourhood, and required yearly the sacrifice of a beautiful maiden. This year the lot had fallen on the King’s daughter, and the whole country was filled with woe and lamentation in consequence. The shepherd felt very sorry for the lovely maiden, and determined to follow the carriage. In a little it halted at the foot of a high mountain. The girl got out, and walked slowly and sadly to meet her terrible fate. The coachman perceived that the shepherd wished to follow her, and warned him not to do so if he valued his life; but the shepherd wouldn’t listen to his advice. When they had climbed about half-way up the hill they saw a terrible-looking monster with the body of a snake, and with huge wings and claws, coming towards them, breathing forth flames of fire, and preparing to seize its victim. Then the shepherd called, ‘Pepper, come to the rescue,’ and the second dog set upon the dragon, and after a fierce struggle bit it so sharply in the neck that the monster rolled over, and in a few moments breathed its last. Then the dog ate up the body, all except its two front teeth, which the shepherd picked up and put in his pocket. The Princess was quite overcome with terror and joy, and fell fainting at the feet of her deliverer. When she recovered her consciousness she begged the shepherd to return with her to her father, who would reward him richly. But the youth answered that he wanted to see something of the world, and that he would return again in three years, and nothing would make him change this resolve. The Princess seated herself once more in her carriage, and, bidding each other farewell, she and the shepherd separated, she to return home, and he to see the world. But while the Princess was driving over a bridge the carriage suddenly stood still, and the coachman turned round to her and said, ‘Your deliverer has gone, and doesn’t thank you for your gratitude. It would be nice of you to make a poor fellow happy; therefore you may tell your father that it was I who slew the dragon, and if you refuse to, I will throw you into the river, and no one will be any the wiser, for they will think the dragon has devoured you.’The maiden was in a dreadful state when she heard these words; but there was nothing for her to do but to swear that she would give out the coachman as her deliverer, and not to divulge the secret to anyone. So they returned to the capital, and everyone was delighted when they saw the Princess had returned unharmed; the black flags were taken down from all the palace towers, and gay- coloured ones put up in their place, and the King embraced his daughter and her supposed rescuer with tears of joy, and, turning to the coachman, he said, ‘You have not only saved the life of my child, but you have also freed the country from a terrible scourge; therefore, it is only fitting that you should be richly rewarded. Take, therefore, my daughter for your wife; but as she is still so young, do not let the marriage be celebrated for another year.’The coachman thanked the King for his graciousness, and was then led away to be richly dressed and instructed in all the arts and graces that befitted his new position. But the poor Princess wept bitterly, though she did not dare to confide her grief to anyone. When the year was over, she begged so hard for another year’s respite that it was granted to her. But this year passed also, and she threw herself at her father’s feet, and begged so piteously for one more year that the King’s heart was melted, and he yielded to her request, much to the Princess’s joy, for she knew that her real deliverer would appear at the end of the third year. And so the year passed away like the other two, and the wedding-day was fixed, and all the people were prepared to feast and make merry. But on the wedding-day it happened that a stranger came to the town with three black dogs. He asked what the meaning of all the feasting and fuss was, and they told him that the King’s daughter was just going to be married to the man who had slain the terrible dragon. The stranger at once denounced the coachman as a liar; but no one would listen to him, and he was seized and thrown into a cell with iron doors. While he was lying on his straw pallet, pondering mournfully on his fate, he thought he heard the low whining of his dogs outside; then an idea dawned on him, and he called out as loudly as he could, ‘Mustard, come to my help,’ and in a second he saw the paws of his biggest dog at the window of his cell, and before he could count two the creature had bitten through the iron bars and stood beside him. Then they both let themselves out of the prison by the window, and the poor youth was free once more, though he felt very sad when he thought that another was to enjoy the reward that rightfully belonged to him. He felt hungry too, so he called his dog ‘Salt,’ and asked him to bring home some food. The faithful creature trotted off, and soon returned with a table-napkin full of the most delicious food, and the napkin itself was embroidered with a kingly crown. The King had just seated himself at the wedding-feast with all his Court, when the dog appeared and licked the Princess’s hand in an appealing manner. With a joyful start she recognised the beast, and bound her own table-napkin round his neck. Then she plucked up her courage and told her father the whole story. The King at once sent a servant to follow the dog, and in a short time the stranger was led into the Kings presence. The former coachman grew as white as a sheet when he saw the shepherd, and, falling on his knees, begged for mercy and pardon. The Princess recognized her deliverer at once, and did not need the proof of the two dragon’s teeth which he drew from his pocket. The coachman was thrown into a dark dungeon, and the shepherd took his place at the Princess’s side, and this time, you may be sure, she did not beg for the wedding to be put off. The young couple lived for some time in great peace and happiness, when suddenly one day the former shepherd bethought himself of his poor sister and expressed a wish to see her again, and to let her share in his good fortune. So they sent a carriage to fetch her, and soon she arrived at the court, and found herself once more in her brother’s arms. Then one of the dogs spoke and said, ‘Our task is done; you have no more need of us. We only waited to see that you did not forget your sister in your prosperity.’ And with these words the three dogs became three birds and flew away into the heavens.",Germany,,506.0,1746

The man used to go out every morning with a clean vessel in his hand, return home with rice enough for the day’s meal, and thus they lived on in extreme poverty. One day a poor Mádhava Brâhmiṇ invited the pair to a feast, and among Mádhavas muffins ( tôśai) are always a part of the good things on festive occasions. So during the feast the beggar and his wife had their fill of muffins. They were so pleased with them, that the woman was extremely anxious to prepare some muffins in her own house, and began to save a little rice every day from what her husband brought her for the purpose. When enough had been thus collected she begged a poor neighbour’s wife to give her a little black pulse which the latter—praised be her charity—readily did. The faces of the beggar and his wife literally glowed with joy that day, for were they not to taste the long-desired muffins for a second time? The woman soon turned the rice she had been saving, and the black pulse she had obtained from her neighbour into a paste, and mixing it well with a little salt, green chillies, coriander seed and curds, set it in a pan on the fire; and with her mouth watering all the while, prepared five muffins! By the time her husband had returned from his collection of alms, she was just turning out of the pan the fifth muffin! And when she placed the whole five muffins before him his mouth, too, began to water. He kept two for himself and two he placed before his wife, but what was to be done with the fifth? He did not understand the way out of this difficulty. That half and half made one, and that each could take two and a half muffins was a question too hard for him to solve. The beloved muffins must not be torn in pieces; so he said to his wife that either he or she must take the remaining one. But how were they to decide which should be the lucky one? Proposed the husband:—“Let us both shut our eyes and stretch ourselves as if in sleep, each on a verandah on either side the kitchen. Whoever opens an eye and speaks first gets only two muffins; and the other gets three.” So great was the desire of each to get the three muffins, that they both abided by the agreement, and the woman, though her mouth watered for the muffins, resolved to go through the ordeal. She placed the five cakes in a pan and covered it over with another pan. She then carefully bolted the door inside and asking her husband to go into the east verandah, she lay down in the west one. Sleep she had none, and with closed eyes kept guard over her husband: for if he spoke first he would have only two muffins, and the other three would come to her share. Equally watchful was her husband over her. Thus passed one whole day—two—three! The house was never opened! No beggar came to receive the morning dole. The whole village began to enquire after the missing beggar. What had become of him? What had become of his wife? “See whether his house is locked on the outside and whether he has left us to go to some other village,” spoke the greyheads. So the village watchman came and tried to push the door open, but it would not open! “Surely,” said they, “it is locked on the inside! Some great calamity must have happened. Perhaps thieves have entered the house, and after plundering their property, murdered the inmates.” “But what property is a beggar likely to have?” thought the village assembly, and not liking to waste time in idle speculations, they sent two watchmen to climb the roof and open the latch from the inside. Meanwhile the whole village, men, women, and children, stood outside the beggar’s house to see what had taken place inside. The watchmen jumped into the house, and to their horror found the beggar and his wife stretched on opposite verandahs like two corpses. They opened the door, and the whole village rushed in. They, too, saw the beggar and his wife lying so still that they thought them to be dead. And though the beggar pair had heard everything that passed around them, neither would open an eye or speak. For whoever did it first would get only two muffins! At the public expense of the village two green litters of bamboo and cocoanut leaves were prepared on which to remove the unfortunate pair to the cremation ground. “How loving they must have been to have died together like this!” said some greybeards of the village. In time the cremation ground was reached, and village watchmen had collected a score of dried cowdung cakes and a bundle of firewood from each house, for the funeral pyre. From these charitable contributions two pyres had been prepared, one for the man and one for the woman. The pyre was then lighted, and when the fire approached his leg, the man thought it time to give up the ordeal and to be satisfied with only two muffins! So while the villagers were still continuing the funeral rites, they suddenly heard a voice:—“I shall be satisfied with two muffins!” Immediately another voice replied from the woman’s pyre:—“I have gained the day; let me have the three!” The villagers were amazed and ran away. One bold man alone stood face to face with the supposed dead husband and wife. He was a bold man, indeed for when a dead man or a man supposed to have died comes to life, village people consider him to be a ghost. However, this bold villager questioned the beggars until he came to know their story. He then went after the runaways and related to them the whole story of the five muffins to their great amazement. But what was to be done to the people who had thus voluntarily faced death out of love for muffins. Persons who had ascended the green litter and slept on the funeral pyre could never come back to the village! If they did the whole village would perish. So the elders built a small hut in a deserted meadow outside the village and made the beggar and his wife live there. Ever after that memorable day our hero and his wife were called the muffin beggar, and the muffin beggar’s wife, and many old ladies and young children from the village use to bring them muffins in the morning and evening, out of pity for them, for had they not loved muffin so much that they underwent death in life?",India,,1750.0,1144

The man used to go out every morning with a clean vessel in his hand, return home with rice enough for the day’s meal, and thus they lived on in extreme poverty. One day a poor Mádhava Brâhmiṇ invited the pair to a feast, and among Mádhavas muffins ( tôśai) are always a part of the good things on festive occasions. So during the feast the beggar and his wife had their fill of muffins. They were so pleased with them, that the woman was extremely anxious to prepare some muffins in her own house, and began to save a little rice every day from what her husband brought her for the purpose. When enough had been thus collected she begged a poor neighbour’s wife to give her a little black pulse which the latter—praised be her charity—readily did. The faces of the beggar and his wife literally glowed with joy that day, for were they not to taste the long-desired muffins for a second time? The woman soon turned the rice she had been saving, and the black pulse she had obtained from her neighbour into a paste, and mixing it well with a little salt, green chillies, coriander seed and curds, set it in a pan on the fire; and with her mouth watering all the while, prepared five muffins! By the time her husband had returned from his collection of alms, she was just turning out of the pan the fifth muffin! And when she placed the whole five muffins before him his mouth, too, began to water. He kept two for himself and two he placed before his wife, but what was to be done with the fifth? He did not understand the way out of this difficulty. That half and half made one, and that each could take two and a half muffins was a question too hard for him to solve. The beloved muffins must not be torn in pieces; so he said to his wife that either he or she must take the remaining one. But how were they to decide which should be the lucky one? Proposed the husband:—“Let us both shut our eyes and stretch ourselves as if in sleep, each on a verandah on either side the kitchen. Whoever opens an eye and speaks first gets only two muffins; and the other gets three.” So great was the desire of each to get the three muffins, that they both abided by the agreement, and the woman, though her mouth watered for the muffins, resolved to go through the ordeal. She placed the five cakes in a pan and covered it over with another pan. She then carefully bolted the door inside and asking her husband to go into the east verandah, she lay down in the west one. Sleep she had none, and with closed eyes kept guard over her husband: for if he spoke first he would have only two muffins, and the other three would come to her share. Equally watchful was her husband over her. Thus passed one whole day—two—three! The house was never opened! No beggar came to receive the morning dole. The whole village began to enquire after the missing beggar. What had become of him? What had become of his wife? “See whether his house is locked on the outside and whether he has left us to go to some other village,” spoke the greyheads. So the village watchman came and tried to push the door open, but it would not open! “Surely,” said they, “it is locked on the inside! Some great calamity must have happened. Perhaps thieves have entered the house, and after plundering their property, murdered the inmates.” “But what property is a beggar likely to have?” thought the village assembly, and not liking to waste time in idle speculations, they sent two watchmen to climb the roof and open the latch from the inside. Meanwhile the whole village, men, women, and children, stood outside the beggar’s house to see what had taken place inside. The watchmen jumped into the house, and to their horror found the beggar and his wife stretched on opposite verandahs like two corpses. They opened the door, and the whole village rushed in. They, too, saw the beggar and his wife lying so still that they thought them to be dead. And though the beggar pair had heard everything that passed around them, neither would open an eye or speak.

He was also called Raiko, and by this name he is best known to all the boys and girls in Great Japan. Under Captain Raiko were three brave guardsmen, one of whom was named Watanabé Tsuna. The duty of these men-at-arms was to watch at the gates leading to the palace. It had come to pass that the blossom capital had fallen in a dreadful condition, because the guards at the other gates had been neglected. Thieves were numerous and murders were frequent, so that every one in the city was afraid to go out into the streets at night. Worse than all else, was the report that oni or imps were prowling around in the dark to seize people by the hair of the head. Then they would drag them away to the mountains, tear the flesh off their bones, and eat them up. The worst place in the city, to which the horned imps came oftenest, was at the south-western gate called the Rajo-mon. To this post of danger, Raiko sent Tsuna, the bravest of his guards. It was on a dark, rainy and dismal night, that Tsuna started, well-armed, to stand sentinel at the gate. His trusty helmet was knotted over his chin, and all the pieces of his armor were well laced up. His sandals were girt tight to his feet, and in his belt was thrust the trusty sword, freshly ground, until its edge was like a razor’s, and with it the owner could cut asunder a hair floating in the air. Arriving at the red pillar of the gate, Tsuna paced up and down the stone way with eyes and ears wide open. The wind was blowing frightfully, the storm howled and the rain fell in such torrents that soon the cords of Tsuna’s armor and his dress were soaked through. The great bronze bell of the temples on the hills boomed out the hours one after another, until a single stroke told Tsuna it was the hour of the Rat ( midnight). Two hours passed, and the hour of the Bull sounded (2 A. M.,) still Tsuna was wide awake. The storm had lulled, but it was darker than ever. The hour of the Tiger (3 o’clock) rung out, and the soft mellow notes of the temple bell died away like a lullaby wooing one to sleep, spite of will and vow. The warrior, almost without knowing it, grew sleepy and fell into a doze. He started and woke up. He shook himself, jingled his armor, pinched himself, and even pulled out his little knife from the wooden scabbard of his dirk, and pricked his leg with the point of it to keep awake, but all in vain. Unconsciously overcome, he leaned against the gate-post, and fell asleep. This was just what the imp wanted. All the time he had been squatting on the cross-piece at the top of the gate waiting his opportunity. He now slid down as softly as a monkey, and with his iron-like claws grabbed Tsuna by the helmet, and began to drag him into the air. In an instant Tsuna was awake. Seizing the hairy wrist of the imp with his left hand, with his right he drew his sword, swept it round his head, and cut off the demon’s arm. The oni, frightened and howling with pain, leaped up the post and disappeared in the clouds. Tsuna waited with drawn sword in hand, lest the oni might come again, but in a few hours morning dawned. The sun rose on the pagodas and gardens and temples of the capitol and the nine-fold circle of flowery hills. Everything was beautiful and bright. Tsuna returned to report to his captain, carrying the oni’s arm in triumph. Raiko examined it, and loudly praised Tsuna for his bravery, and rewarded him with a silken sash. Now it is said that if an oni’s arm be cut off it cannot be made to unite with the body again, if kept apart for a week. So Raiko warned Tsuna to lock it up, and watch it night and day, lest it be stolen from him. So Tsuna went to the stone-cutters who made idols of Buddha, mortars for pounding rice, and coffers for burying money in to be hidden away in the ground, and bought a strong box cut out of the solid stone. It had a heavy lid on it, which slid in a groove and came out only by touching a secret spring. Then setting it in his bed chamber, he guarded it day and night, keeping the gate and all his doors locked. He allowed no one who was a stranger to look at the trophy. Six days passed by, and Tsuna began to think his prize was sure, for were not all his doors tight shut? So he set the box out in the middle of the room, and twisting some rice-straw fringe in token of sure victory and rejoicing, he sat down in ease before it. He took off his armor and put on his court robes. During the evening, but rather late, there was a feeble knock like that of an old woman at the gate outside. Tsuna cried out, “Who’s there?” The squeaky voice of his aunt ( as it seemed), who was a very old woman, replied “Me, I want to see my nephew, to praise him for his bravery in cutting the oni’s arm off.” So Tsuna let her in and carefully locking the door behind her, helped the old crone into the room, where she sat down on the mats in front of the box and very close to it. Then she grew very talkative, and praised her nephew’s exploit, until Tsuna felt very proud. All the time the old woman’s left shoulder was covered with her dress while her right hand was out. Then she begged earnestly to be allowed to see the limb. Tsuna at first politely refused, but she urged, until yielding affectionately he slid back the stone lid just a little. “This is my arm” cried the old hag, turning into an oni, and dragging out the arm. She flew up to the ceiling, and was out of the smoke-slide through the roof in a twinkling. Tsuna rushed out of the house to shoot her with an arrow, but he saw only a demon far off in the clouds grinning horribly. He noted carefully however that the direction of the imps’ flight was to the north-west.

He was also called Raiko, and by this name he is best known to all the boys and girls in Great Japan. Under Captain Raiko were three brave guardsmen, one of whom was named Watanabé Tsuna. The duty of these men-at-arms was to watch at the gates leading to the palace. It had come to pass that the blossom capital had fallen in a dreadful condition, because the guards at the other gates had been neglected. Thieves were numerous and murders were frequent, so that every one in the city was afraid to go out into the streets at night. Worse than all else, was the report that oni or imps were prowling around in the dark to seize people by the hair of the head. Then they would drag them away to the mountains, tear the flesh off their bones, and eat them up. The worst place in the city, to which the horned imps came oftenest, was at the south-western gate called the Rajo-mon. To this post of danger, Raiko sent Tsuna, the bravest of his guards. It was on a dark, rainy and dismal night, that Tsuna started, well-armed, to stand sentinel at the gate. His trusty helmet was knotted over his chin, and all the pieces of his armor were well laced up. His sandals were girt tight to his feet, and in his belt was thrust the trusty sword, freshly ground, until its edge was like a razor’s, and with it the owner could cut asunder a hair floating in the air. Arriving at the red pillar of the gate, Tsuna paced up and down the stone way with eyes and ears wide open. The wind was blowing frightfully, the storm howled and the rain fell in such torrents that soon the cords of Tsuna’s armor and his dress were soaked through. The great bronze bell of the temples on the hills boomed out the hours one after another, until a single stroke told Tsuna it was the hour of the Rat ( midnight). Two hours passed, and the hour of the Bull sounded (2 A. M.,) still Tsuna was wide awake. The storm had lulled, but it was darker than ever. The hour of the Tiger (3 o’clock) rung out, and the soft mellow notes of the temple bell died away like a lullaby wooing one to sleep, spite of will and vow. The warrior, almost without knowing it, grew sleepy and fell into a doze. He started and woke up. He shook himself, jingled his armor, pinched himself, and even pulled out his little knife from the wooden scabbard of his dirk, and pricked his leg with the point of it to keep awake, but all in vain. Unconsciously overcome, he leaned against the gate-post, and fell asleep. This was just what the imp wanted. All the time he had been squatting on the cross-piece at the top of the gate waiting his opportunity. He now slid down as softly as a monkey, and with his iron-like claws grabbed Tsuna by the helmet, and began to drag him into the air. In an instant Tsuna was awake. Seizing the hairy wrist of the imp with his left hand, with his right he drew his sword, swept it round his head, and cut off the demon’s arm. The oni, frightened and howling with pain, leaped up the post and disappeared in the clouds. Tsuna waited with drawn sword in hand, lest the oni might come again, but in a few hours morning dawned. The sun rose on the pagodas and gardens and temples of the capitol and the nine-fold circle of flowery hills. Everything was beautiful and bright. Tsuna returned to report to his captain, carrying the oni’s arm in triumph. Raiko examined it, and loudly praised Tsuna for his bravery, and rewarded him with a silken sash. Now it is said that if an oni’s arm be cut off it cannot be made to unite with the body again, if kept apart for a week. So Raiko warned Tsuna to lock it up, and watch it night and day, lest it be stolen from him. So Tsuna went to the stone-cutters who made idols of Buddha, mortars for pounding rice, and coffers for burying money in to be hidden away in the ground, and bought a strong box cut out of the solid stone. It had a heavy lid on it, which slid in a groove and came out only by touching a secret spring. Then setting it in his bed chamber, he guarded it day and night, keeping the gate and all his doors locked. He allowed no one who was a stranger to look at the trophy. Six days passed by, and Tsuna began to think his prize was sure, for were not all his doors tight shut? So he set the box out in the middle of the room, and twisting some rice-straw fringe in token of sure victory and rejoicing, he sat down in ease before it. He took off his armor and put on his court robes. During the evening, but rather late, there was a feeble knock like that of an old woman at the gate outside. Tsuna cried out, “Who’s there?” The squeaky voice of his aunt ( as it seemed), who was a very old woman, replied “Me, I want to see my nephew, to praise him for his bravery in cutting the oni’s arm off.” So Tsuna let her in and carefully locking the door behind her, helped the old crone into the room, where she sat down on the mats in front of the box and very close to it. Then she grew very talkative, and praised her nephew’s exploit, until Tsuna felt very proud. All the time the old woman’s left shoulder was covered with her dress while her right hand was out. Then she begged earnestly to be allowed to see the limb. Tsuna at first politely refused, but she urged, until yielding affectionately he slid back the stone lid just a little. “This is my arm” cried the old hag, turning into an oni, and dragging out the arm. She flew up to the ceiling, and was out of the smoke-slide through the roof in a twinkling. Tsuna rushed out of the house to shoot her with an arrow, but he saw only a demon far off in the clouds grinning horribly. He noted carefully however that the direction of the imps’ flight was to the north-west. A council was now held by Raiko’s band, and it was decided that the lurking-place of the demons must be in the mountains of Oyé in the province of Tango. It was resolved to hunt out and destroy the imps.",Japan,,1543.0,1164

He was fond of shooting with a gun, and thus very often committed the sin ( according to the teaching of holy Buddha) of taking life. He would never hearken to the admonitions of his daughters. These, mindful of the future, and aghast at the prospect in store for him in the world to come, frequently endeavored to convert him. Many were the tears they shed. At last one day, after they had pleaded with him more earnestly still than before, the father, touched by their supplications, promised to shoot no more. But, after a a while, some of his neighbors came round to request him to shoot for them two storks. He was easily led to consent by the strength of his natural liking for the sport. Still he would not allow a word to be breathed to his daughters. He slipped out at night, gun in hand, after they were, as he imagined, fast asleep. They, however, had heard everything, and the elder sister said to the younger: “Do what we may, our father will not condescend to follow our words of counsel, and nothing now remains but to bring him to a knowledge of the truth by the sacrifice of one of our own lives. To-night is fortunately moonless; and if I put on white garments and go to the neighborhood of the bay, he will take me for a stork and shoot me dead. Do you continue to live and tend our father with all the services of filial piety.” Thus she spake, her eyes dimmed with the rolling tears. But the younger sister, with many sobs, exclaimed: “For you, my sister, for you is it to receive the inheritance of this house. So do you condescend to be the one to live, and to practise filial devotion to our father, while I will offer up my life.” Thus did each strive for death. The elder one, without more words, seizing a white garment rushed out of the house. The younger one, unwilling to cede to her the place of honor, putting on a white gown also, followed in her track to the shore of the bay. There, making her way to her among the rushes, she continued the dispute as to which of the two should be the one to die. Meanwhile the father, peering around him in the darkness, saw something white. Taking it for the storks, he aimed at the spot with his gun, and did not miss his shot, for it pierced through the ribs of the elder of the two girls. The younger, helpless in her grief, bent over her sister’s body. The father, not dreaming of what he was about, and astonished to find that his having shot one of the storks did not make the other fly away, discharged another shot at the remaining white figure. Lamentable to relate, he hit his second daughter as he had the first. She fell, pierced through the chest, and was laid on the same grassy pillow as her sister. The father, pleased with his success, came up to the rushes to look for his game. But what! no storks, alas! alas! No, only his two daughters! Filled with consternation, he asked what it all meant. The girls, breathing with difficulty, told him that their resolve had been to show him the crime of taking life, and thus respectfully to cause him to desist therefrom. They expired before they had time to say more. The father was filled with sorrow and remorse. He took the two corpses home on his back. As there was now no help for what was done, he placed them reverently on a wood stack, and there they burnt, making smoke to the blowing wind. From that hour he was a converted man. He built himself a small cell of branches of trees, near the village bridge. Placing therein the memorial tablets of his two daughters, he performed before them the due religious rites, and became the most pious follower of Buddha. Ah! that was filial piety in very truth! a marvel, that these girls should throw away their own lives, so that, by exterminating the evil seed in their father’s conduct in this world, they might guard him from its awful fruit in the world to come!",Japan,,459.0,744

They, however, had heard everything, and the elder sister said to the younger: “Do what we may, our father will not condescend to follow our words of counsel, and nothing now remains but to bring him to a knowledge of the truth by the sacrifice of one of our own lives. To-night is fortunately moonless; and if I put on white garments and go to the neighborhood of the bay, he will take me for a stork and shoot me dead. Do you continue to live and tend our father with all the services of filial piety.” Thus she spake, her eyes dimmed with the rolling tears. But the younger sister, with many sobs, exclaimed: “For you, my sister, for you is it to receive the inheritance of this house. So do you condescend to be the one to live, and to practise filial devotion to our father, while I will offer up my life.” Thus did each strive for death. The elder one, without more words, seizing a white garment rushed out of the house. The younger one, unwilling to cede to her the place of honor, putting on a white gown also, followed in her track to the shore of the bay. There, making her way to her among the rushes, she continued the dispute as to which of the two should be the one to die. Meanwhile the father, peering around him in the darkness, saw something white. Taking it for the storks, he aimed at the spot with his gun, and did not miss his shot, for it pierced through the ribs of the elder of the two girls. The younger, helpless in her grief, bent over her sister’s body. The father, not dreaming of what he was about, and astonished to find that his having shot one of the storks did not make the other fly away, discharged another shot at the remaining white figure. Lamentable to relate, he hit his second daughter as he had the first. She fell, pierced through the chest, and was laid on the same grassy pillow as her sister. The father, pleased with his success, came up to the rushes to look for his game. But what! no storks, alas! alas! No, only his two daughters! Filled with consternation, he asked what it all meant. The girls, breathing with difficulty, told him that their resolve had been to show him the crime of taking life, and thus respectfully to cause him to desist therefrom. They expired before they had time to say more. The father was filled with sorrow and remorse. He took the two corpses home on his back. As there was now no help for what was done, he placed them reverently on a wood stack, and there they burnt, making smoke to the blowing wind. From that hour he was a converted man. He built himself a small cell of branches of trees, near the village bridge. Placing therein the memorial tablets of his two daughters, he performed before them the due religious rites, and became the most pious follower of Buddha. Ah! that was filial piety in very truth! a marvel, that these girls should throw away their own lives, so that, by exterminating the evil seed in their father’s conduct in this world, they might guard him from its awful fruit in the world to come!",Japan,,459.0,744

These, mindful of the future, and aghast at the prospect in store for him in the world to come, frequently endeavored to convert him. Many were the tears they shed.

The farmer, knowing that the man was very slow-witted, gave him most careful instructions as to everything that he was to do. Finally he said: ‘If a wolf or any wild animal attempts to hurt the flock you should pick up a big stone like this’ ( suiting the action to the word) ‘and throw a few such at him, and he will be afraid and go away.’ The weaver said that he understood, and started with the flocks to the hillsides where they grazed all day. By chance in the afternoon a leopard appeared, and the weaver instantly ran home as fast as he could to get the stones which the farmer had shown him, to throw at the creature. When he came back all the flock were scattered or killed, and when the farmer heard the tale he beat him soundly. ‘Were there no stones on the hillside that you should run back to get them, you senseless one?’ he cried; ‘you are not fit to herd sheep. To-day you shall stay at home and mind my old mother who is sick, perhaps you will be able to drive flies off her face, if you can’t drive beasts away from sheep!’So, the next day, the weaver was left at home to take care of the farmer’s old sick mother. Now as she lay outside on a bed, it turned out that the flies became very troublesome, and the weaver looked round for something to drive them away with; and as he had been told to pick up the nearest stone to drive the beasts away from the flock, he thought he would this time show how cleverly he could obey orders. Accordingly he seized the nearest stone, which was a big, heavy one, and dashed it at the flies; but, unhappily, he slew the poor old woman also; and then, being afraid of the wrath of the farmer, he fled and was not seen again in that neighbourhood. All that day and all the next night he walked, and at length he came to a village where a great many weavers lived together. ‘You are welcome,’ said they. ‘Eat and sleep, for to-morrow six of us start in search of fresh wool to weave, and we pray you to give us your company.’‘Willingly,’ answered the weaver. So the next morning the seven weavers set out to go to the village where they could buy what they wanted. On the way they had to cross a ravine which lately had been full of water, but now was quite dry. The weavers, however, were accustomed to swim over this ravine; therefore, regardless of the fact that this time it was dry, they stripped, and, tying their clothes on their heads, they proceeded to swim across the dry sand and rocks that formed the bed of the ravine. Thus they got to the other side without further damage than bruised knees and elbows, and as soon as they were over, one of them began to count the party to make sure that all were safe there. He counted all except himself, and then cried out that somebody was missing! This set each of them counting; but each made the same mistake of counting all except himself, so that they became certain that one of their party was missing! They ran up and down the bank of the ravine wringing their hands in great distress and looking for signs of their lost comrade. There a farmer found them and asked what was the matter. ‘Alas!’ said one, ‘seven of us started from the other bank and one must have been drowned on the crossing, as we can only find six remaining!’ The farmer eyed them a minute, and then, picking up his stick, he dealt each a sounding blow, counting, as he did so, ‘One! two! three!’ and so on up to the seven.

As they had been with him several years, he one day said to them, “I am old, and want to sit in the chimney-corner, go out, and whichever obrings me the best horse home, I will give the mill to him, and in return for it he shall take care of me till my death.” The third of the boys was, however, the drudge, who was looked on as foolish by the others; they begrudged the mill to him, and afterwards he would not have it. Then all three went out together, and when they came to the village, the two said to stupid Hans, “You mayst just as well stay here, because as long as you live ypu will never get a horse.” Hans, however, went with them, and when it was night they came to a cave in which they lay down to sleep. The two sharp ones waited until Hans had fallen asleep, then they got up, and went away leaving him where he was. And they thought they had done a very clever thing, but it was certain to turn out poorly for them. When the sun arose, and Hans woke up, he was lying in a deep cavern. He looked around on every side and exclaimed, “Oh, heavens, where am I?” Then he got up and climbed out of the cave, went into the forest, and thought, “Here I am quite alone and deserted, how shall I get a horse now?” Whilst he was thus walking full of thought, he met a small tabby-cat which said quite kindly, “Hans, where are you going?” “Sadly, you cannot help me.” “I know what you desire,” said the cat. “You wish to have a beautiful horse. Come with me, and be my faithful servant for seven years, and then I will give you one more beautiful than any you have ever seen in your whole life.” “Well, this is a wonderful cat!” thought Hans, “but I am determined to see if she is telling the truth.” So she took him with her into her enchanted castle, where there were nothing but cats who were her servants. They leapt nimbly upstairs and downstairs, and were merry and happy. In the evening when they sat down to dinner, three of them had to make music. One played the bassoon, the other the fiddle, and the third put the trumpet to his lips, and blew out his cheeks as much as he possibly could. When they had dined, the table was carried away, and the cat said, “Now, Hans, come and dance with me.” “No,” said he, “I won’t dance with a pussy cat. I have never done that yet.” “Then take him to bed,” said she to the cats. So one of them helped him to his bed-room, one pulled his shoes off, one his stockings, and at last one of them blew out the candle. Next morning they returned and helped him out of bed, one put his stockings on for him, one tied his garters, one brought his shoes, one washed him, and one dried his face with her tail. “That feels very soft!” said Hans. He, however, had to serve the cat, and chop some wood every day, and to do that he had an axe made of silver, and his saw was made of silver and the mallet was made of copper. So he chopped the wood well; stayed there in the house and had good meat and drink, but never saw any one but the tabby-cat and her servants. Once she said to him, “Go and mow my meadow, and dry the grass,” and gave him a scythe of silver, and a whetstone of gold, but asked him to return them carefully. So Hans went out, and did what she asked and when he had finished the work, he carried the scythe, whetstone, and hay to the house, and asked if it was time for his reward. “No,” said the cat, “you must first do something more for me, there is silver wood of silver, as well as an axe made of wood and everything needed to build me a small house.” Then Hans built the small house, and said that he had now done everything, and still he had no horse. Nevertheless, the seven years had gone by with him as if they were six months. The cat asked him if he would like to see her horses? “Yes,” said Hans. Then she opened the door of the small house, and when she had opened it, there stood twelve horses,—such horses, so bright and shining, that his heart rejoiced at the sight of them. And now she gave him to eat and to drink, and said, “Go home, I will not give my horse away tio you today; but in three days I will come and bring it.” So Hans set out, and she showed him the way to the mill. She had, however, never once given him a new coat, and he had been obliged to keep on his dirty old shirt, which he had brought with him, and which had become too small for him over the seven years.  When he reached home, the two other apprentices were there again as well, and each of them certainly had brought a horse with him, but one of them was a blind one, and the other lame. They asked Hans where his horse was? “It will follow me in three days.” Then they laughed and said, “Indeed, stupid Hans, where will you get a horse? It will be a fine one!” Hans went into the parlour, but the miller said he should not sit down to eat at the table, for he was so ragged and torn, that they would all be ashamed of him if any one came in. So they gave him a bit of food outside, and at night, when they went to sleep, the two others would not let him use a bed, and at last he was forced to creep into the goose-house, and lie down on a bit of straw. In the morning, the three days had passed, and a coach came with six horses and they shone so bright that it was delightful to see them!—and a servant brought a seventh as well, which was for the poor miller’s boy. And a magnificent princess came from the coach and went into the mill, and this princess was the little tabby-cat  poor Hans had served for seven years. She asked the miller where the miller’s boy and drudge was? Then the miller said, “We cannot have him here in the mill, for he is so ragged; he is lying in the goose-house.” Then the King’s daughter said that they were to bring him immediately. So they brought him out, and he had to hold his little shirt together to cover himself. The servants unpacked splendid clothes, and washed him and dressed him, and when that was done, no King could have looked more handsome. Then the maiden asked to see the horses which the other apprentices had brought home with them, and one of them was blind and the other lame. So she ordered the servant to bring the seventh horse, and when the miller saw it, he said that such a horse had never been in his yard. “And that is for the third miller’s-boy,” she said. “Then he must have the mill,” said the miller, but the King’s daughter said that the horse was there, and that he was to keep his mill as well, and took her faithful Hans and set him in the coach, and drove away with him. They first drove to the little house which he had built with the silver tools, and he saw it was a great castle, and everything inside it made of silver and gold; and then she married him, and he was rich, so rich that he had enough for all the rest of his life. After this, let no one say that any one who is silly can never become an important person.",Germany,,1930.0,1377

As they had been with him several years, he one day said to them, “I am old, and want to sit in the chimney-corner, go out, and whichever obrings me the best horse home, I will give the mill to him, and in return for it he shall take care of me till my death.” The third of the boys was, however, the drudge, who was looked on as foolish by the others; they begrudged the mill to him, and afterwards he would not have it. Then all three went out together, and when they came to the village, the two said to stupid Hans, “You mayst just as well stay here, because as long as you live ypu will never get a horse.” Hans, however, went with them, and when it was night they came to a cave in which they lay down to sleep. The two sharp ones waited until Hans had fallen asleep, then they got up, and went away leaving him where he was. And they thought they had done a very clever thing, but it was certain to turn out poorly for them. When the sun arose, and Hans woke up, he was lying in a deep cavern. He looked around on every side and exclaimed, “Oh, heavens, where am I?” Then he got up and climbed out of the cave, went into the forest, and thought, “Here I am quite alone and deserted, how shall I get a horse now?” Whilst he was thus walking full of thought, he met a small tabby-cat which said quite kindly, “Hans, where are you going?” “Sadly, you cannot help me.” “I know what you desire,” said the cat. “You wish to have a beautiful horse. Come with me, and be my faithful servant for seven years, and then I will give you one more beautiful than any you have ever seen in your whole life.” “Well, this is a wonderful cat!” thought Hans, “but I am determined to see if she is telling the truth.” So she took him with her into her enchanted castle, where there were nothing but cats who were her servants. They leapt nimbly upstairs and downstairs, and were merry and happy. In the evening when they sat down to dinner, three of them had to make music. One played the bassoon, the other the fiddle, and the third put the trumpet to his lips, and blew out his cheeks as much as he possibly could. When they had dined, the table was carried away, and the cat said, “Now, Hans, come and dance with me.” “No,” said he, “I won’t dance with a pussy cat. I have never done that yet.” “Then take him to bed,” said she to the cats. So one of them helped him to his bed-room, one pulled his shoes off, one his stockings, and at last one of them blew out the candle. Next morning they returned and helped him out of bed, one put his stockings on for him, one tied his garters, one brought his shoes, one washed him, and one dried his face with her tail. “That feels very soft!” said Hans. He, however, had to serve the cat, and chop some wood every day, and to do that he had an axe made of silver, and his saw was made of silver and the mallet was made of copper. So he chopped the wood well; stayed there in the house and had good meat and drink, but never saw any one but the tabby-cat and her servants. Once she said to him, “Go and mow my meadow, and dry the grass,” and gave him a scythe of silver, and a whetstone of gold, but asked him to return them carefully. So Hans went out, and did what she asked and when he had finished the work, he carried the scythe, whetstone, and hay to the house, and asked if it was time for his reward. “No,” said the cat, “you must first do something more for me, there is silver wood of silver, as well as an axe made of wood and everything needed to build me a small house.” Then Hans built the small house, and said that he had now done everything, and still he had no horse. Nevertheless, the seven years had gone by with him as if they were six months. The cat asked him if he would like to see her horses? “Yes,” said Hans. Then she opened the door of the small house, and when she had opened it, there stood twelve horses,—such horses, so bright and shining, that his heart rejoiced at the sight of them.

When they grew up, he was suddenly seized with a wish to know if they, on their part, truly loved him, and he made up his mind that he would give his kingdom to whichever best proved her devotion. So he called the elder Princess and said to her, ‘How much do you love me?’‘As the apple of my eye!’ answered she. ‘Ah!’ exclaimed the King, kissing her tenderly as he spoke, ‘you are indeed a good daughter.’Then he sent for the younger, and asked her how much she loved him. ‘I look upon you, my father,’ she answered, ‘as I look upon salt in my food.’But the King did not like her words, and ordered her to quit the court, and never again to appear before him. The poor Princess went sadly up to her room and began to cry, but when she was reminded of her father’s commands, she dried her eyes, and made a bundle of her jewels and her best dresses and hurriedly left the castle where she was born. She walked straight along the road in front of her, without knowing very well where she was going or what was to become of her, for she had never been shown how to work, and all she had learnt consisted of a few household rules, and receipts of dishes which her mother had taught her long ago. And as she was afraid that no housewife would want to engage a girl with such a pretty face, she determined to make herself as ugly as she could. She therefore took off the dress that she was wearing and put on some horrible old rags belonging to a beggar, all torn and covered with mud. After that she smeared mud all over her hands and face, and shook her hair into a great tangle. Having thus changed her appearance, she went about offering herself as a goose-girl or shepherdess. But the farmers’ wives would have nothing to say to such a dirty maiden, and sent her away with a morsel of bread for charity’s sake. After walking for a great many days without being able to find any work, she came to a large farm where they were in want of a shepherdess, and engaged her gladly. One day when she was keeping her sheep in a lonely tract of land, she suddenly felt a wish to dress herself in her robes of splendour. She washed herself carefully in the stream, and as she always carried her bundle with her, it was easy to shake off her rags, and transform herself in a few moments into a great lady. The King’s son, who had lost his way out hunting, perceived this lovely damsel a long way off, and wished to look at her closer. But as soon as the girl saw what he was at, she fled into the wood as swiftly as a bird. The Prince ran after her, but as he was running he caught his foot in the root of a tree and fell, and when he got up again, she was nowhere to be seen. When she was quite safe, she put on her rags again, and smeared over her face and hands. However the young Prince, who was both hot and thirsty, found his way to the farm, to ask for a drink of cider, and he inquired the name of the beautiful lady that kept the sheep. At this everyone began to laugh, for they said that the shepherdess was one of the ugliest and dirtiest creatures under the sun. The Prince thought some witchcraft must be at work, and he hastened away before the return of the shepherdess, who became that evening the butt of everybody’s jests. But the King’s son thought often of the lovely maiden whom he had only seen for a moment, though she seemed to him much more fascinating than any lady of the Court. At last he dreamed of nothing else, and grew thinner day by day till his parents inquired what was the matter, promising to do all they could to make him as happy as he once was. He dared not tell them the truth, lest they should laugh at him, so he only said that he should like some bread baked by the kitchen girl in the distant farm. Although the wish appeared rather odd, they hastened to fulfil it, and the farmer was told the request of the King’s son. The maiden showed no surprise at receiving such an order, but merely asked for some flour, salt, and water, and also that she might be left alone in a little room adjoining the oven, where the kneading- trough stood. Before beginning her work she washed herself carefully, and even put on her rings; but, while she was baking, one of her rings slid into the dough. When she had finished she dirtied herself again, and let the lumps of the dough stick to her fingers, so that she became as ugly as before. The loaf, which was a very little one, was brought to the King’s son, who ate it with pleasure. But in cutting it he found the ring of the Princess, and declared to his parents that he would marry the girl whom that ring fitted. So the King made a proclamation through his whole kingdom and ladies came from afar to lay claim to the honour. But the ring was so tiny that even those who had the smallest hands could only get it on their little fingers. In a short time all the maidens of the kingdom, including the peasant girls, had tried on the ring, and the King was just about to announce that their efforts had been in vain, when the Prince observed that he had not yet seen the shepherdess. They sent to fetch her, and she arrived covered with rags, but with her hands cleaner than usual, so that she could easily slip on the ring. The King’s son declared that he would fulfil his promise, and when his parents mildly remarked that the girl was only a keeper of sheep, and a very ugly one too, the maiden boldly said that she was born a princess, and that, if they would only give her some water and leave her alone in a room for a few minutes, she would show that she could look as well as anyone in fine clothes. They did what she asked, and when she entered in a magnificent dress, she looked so beautiful that all saw she must be a princess in disguise. The King’s son recognized the charming damsel of whom he had once caught a glimpse, and, flinging himself at her feet, asked if she would marry him. The Princess then told her story, and said that it would be necessary to send an ambassador to her father to ask his consent and to invite him to the wedding. The Princess’s father, who had never ceased to repent his harshness towards his daughter, had sought her through the land, but as no one could tell him anything of her, he supposed her dead. Therefore it was with great joy he heard that she was living and that a king’s son asked her in marriage, and he quitted his kingdom with his elder daughter so as to be present at the ceremony. By the orders of the bride, they only served her father at the wedding breakfast bread without salt, and meat without seasoning. Seeing him make faces, and eat very little, his daughter, who sat beside him, inquired if his dinner was not to his taste. ‘No,’ he replied, ‘the dishes are carefully cooked and sent up, but they are all so dreadfully tasteless.’‘Did not I tell you, my father, that salt was the best thing in life? And yet, when I compared you to salt, to show how much I loved you, you thought slightingly of me and you chased me from your presence.’The King embraced his daughter, and allowed that he had been wrong to misinterpret her words. Then, for the rest of the wedding feast they gave him bread made with salt, and dishes with seasoning, and he said they were the very best he had ever eaten.",France,,914.0,1405

When they grew up, he was suddenly seized with a wish to know if they, on their part, truly loved him, and he made up his mind that he would give his kingdom to whichever best proved her devotion. So he called the elder Princess and said to her, ‘How much do you love me?’‘As the apple of my eye!’ answered she. ‘Ah!’ exclaimed the King, kissing her tenderly as he spoke, ‘you are indeed a good daughter.’Then he sent for the younger, and asked her how much she loved him. ‘I look upon you, my father,’ she answered, ‘as I look upon salt in my food.’But the King did not like her words, and ordered her to quit the court, and never again to appear before him. The poor Princess went sadly up to her room and began to cry, but when she was reminded of her father’s commands, she dried her eyes, and made a bundle of her jewels and her best dresses and hurriedly left the castle where she was born. She walked straight along the road in front of her, without knowing very well where she was going or what was to become of her, for she had never been shown how to work, and all she had learnt consisted of a few household rules, and receipts of dishes which her mother had taught her long ago. And as she was afraid that no housewife would want to engage a girl with such a pretty face, she determined to make herself as ugly as she could. She therefore took off the dress that she was wearing and put on some horrible old rags belonging to a beggar, all torn and covered with mud. After that she smeared mud all over her hands and face, and shook her hair into a great tangle. Having thus changed her appearance, she went about offering herself as a goose-girl or shepherdess. But the farmers’ wives would have nothing to say to such a dirty maiden, and sent her away with a morsel of bread for charity’s sake. After walking for a great many days without being able to find any work, she came to a large farm where they were in want of a shepherdess, and engaged her gladly. One day when she was keeping her sheep in a lonely tract of land, she suddenly felt a wish to dress herself in her robes of splendour. She washed herself carefully in the stream, and as she always carried her bundle with her, it was easy to shake off her rags, and transform herself in a few moments into a great lady. The King’s son, who had lost his way out hunting, perceived this lovely damsel a long way off, and wished to look at her closer. But as soon as the girl saw what he was at, she fled into the wood as swiftly as a bird. The Prince ran after her, but as he was running he caught his foot in the root of a tree and fell, and when he got up again, she was nowhere to be seen. When she was quite safe, she put on her rags again, and smeared over her face and hands. However the young Prince, who was both hot and thirsty, found his way to the farm, to ask for a drink of cider, and he inquired the name of the beautiful lady that kept the sheep. At this everyone began to laugh, for they said that the shepherdess was one of the ugliest and dirtiest creatures under the sun. The Prince thought some witchcraft must be at work, and he hastened away before the return of the shepherdess, who became that evening the butt of everybody’s jests. But the King’s son thought often of the lovely maiden whom he had only seen for a moment, though she seemed to him much more fascinating than any lady of the Court. At last he dreamed of nothing else, and grew thinner day by day till his parents inquired what was the matter, promising to do all they could to make him as happy as he once was. He dared not tell them the truth, lest they should laugh at him, so he only said that he should like some bread baked by the kitchen girl in the distant farm. Although the wish appeared rather odd, they hastened to fulfil it, and the farmer was told the request of the King’s son. The maiden showed no surprise at receiving such an order, but merely asked for some flour, salt, and water, and also that she might be left alone in a little room adjoining the oven, where the kneading- trough stood. Before beginning her work she washed herself carefully, and even put on her rings; but, while she was baking, one of her rings slid into the dough. When she had finished she dirtied herself again, and let the lumps of the dough stick to her fingers, so that she became as ugly as before. The loaf, which was a very little one, was brought to the King’s son, who ate it with pleasure.

They had it all to themselves, except for a turtle, who was many years older than they were, and had come there before them, and, luckily, instead of taking a dislike to the turtle, as so often happens when you have only one person to speak to, they became great friends, and spent most of the day in each other’s company. All went on smoothly and happily till one summer, ‘when the rains failed and the sun shone so fiercely that every morning there was a little less water in the lake and a little more mud on the bank. The water-lilies around the edge began to droop, and the palms to hang their heads, and the ducks’ favourite swimming place, where they could dive the deepest, to grow shallower and shallower. At length there came a morning when the ducks looked at each other uneasily, and before nightfall they had whispered that if at the end of two days rain had not come, they must fly away and seek a new home, for if they stayed in their old one, which they loved so much, they would certainly die of thirst. Earnestly they watched the sky for many hours before they tucked their heads under their wings and fell asleep from sheer weariness, but not the tiniest cloud was to be seen covering the stars that shone so big and brilliant, and hung so low in the heavens that you felt as if you could touch them. So, when the morning broke, they made up their minds that they must go and tell the turtle of their plans, and bid him farewell. They found him comfortably curled up on a pile of dead rushes, more than half asleep, for he was old, and could not venture out in the heat as he once used. ‘Ah ! here you are,’ he cried; ‘I began to wonder if I was ever going to see you again, for, somehow, though the lake has grown smaller, I seem to have grown weaker, and it is lonely spending all day and night by oneself !’‘Oh ! my friend,’ answered the elder of the two ducks, ‘if you have suffered we have suffered also. Besides, I have something to tell you, that I fear will cause you greater pain still. If we do not wish to die of thirst we must leave this place at once, and seek another where the sun’s rays do not come. My heart bleeds to say this, for there is nothing — nothing else in the world — which would have induced us to separate from you.’The turtle was so astonished as well as so distressed at the duck’s speech that for a moment he could find no words to reply. But when he had forced back his tears, he said in a shaky voice: ‘How can you think that I am able to live without you, when for so long you have been my only friends ? If you leave me, death will speedily put an end to my grief.’‘Our sorrow is as great as yours,’ answered the other duck, ‘but what can we do ? And remember that if we are not here to drink the water, there will be the more for you ! If it had not been for this terrible misfortune, be sure that nothing would have parted us from one whom we love so dearly.’‘My friends,’ replied the turtle, ‘water is as necessary to me as to you, and if death stares in your faces, it stares in mine also. But in the name of all the years we have passed together, do not, I beseech you, leave me to perish here alone ! Wherever you may go take me with you !’There was a pause. The ducks felt wretched at the thought of abandoning their old comrade, yet, at the same time, how could they grant his prayer ? It seemed quite impossible, and at length one of them spoke: ‘Oh, how can I find words to refuse ?’ cried he, ‘yet how can we do what you ask ? Consider that, like yours, our bodies are heavy and our feet small. Therefore, how could we walk with you over mountains and deserts, till we reached a land where the sun’s rays no longer burn ? Why, before the day was out we should all three be dead of fatigue and hunger ! No, our only hope lies in our wings — and, alas ! you cannot fly !’‘No, I cannot fly, of course,’ answered the turtle, with a sigh. ‘But you are so clever, and have seen so much of the world – surely you can think of some plan ?’ And he fixed his eyes eagerly on them. Now, when the ducks saw how ardently the turtle wished to accompany them their hearts were touched, and making a sign to their friend that they wished to be alone they swam out into the lake to consult together. Though he could not hear what they said, the turtle could watch, and the half-hour that their talk lasted felt to him like a hundred years. At length he beheld them returning side by side, and so great was his anxiety to know his fate he almost died from excitement before they reached him. ‘We hope we have found a plan that may do for you,’ said the big duck gravely, ‘but we must warn you that it is not without great danger, especially if you are not careful to follow our directions.’‘How is it possible that I should not follow your directions when my life and happiness are at stake ?’ asked the turtle joyfully. ‘Tell me what they are, and I will promise to obey them gratefully.’‘Well, then,’ answered the duck, ‘whilst we are carrying you through the air, in the manner that we have fixed upon, you must remain as quiet as if you were dead. However high above the earth you may find yourself, you must not feel afraid, nor move your feet nor open your mouth. No matter what you see or hear, it is absolutely needful for you to be perfectly still, or I cannot answer for the consequences.’‘I will he absolutely obedient,’ answered the turtle, ‘not only on this occasion but during all my life; and once more I promise faithfully not to move head or foot, to fear nothing, and never to speak a word during the whole journey.’This being settled, the ducks swam about till they found, floating in the lake, a good stout stick. This they tied to their necks with some of the tough water-lily roots, and returned as quickly as they could to the turtle. ‘Now,’ said the elder duck, pushing the stick gently towards his friend, ‘take this stick firmly in your mouth, and do not let it go till we have set you down on earth again.’The turtle did as he was told, and the ducks in their turn seized the stick by the two ends, spread their wings and mounted swiftly into the air, the turtle hanging between them. For a while all went well. They swept across valleys, over great mountains, above ruined cities, but no lake was to be seen anywhere. Still, the turtle had faith in his friends, and bravely hung on to the stick. At length they saw in the distance a small village, and very soon they were passing over the roofs of the houses. The people were so astonished at the strange sight, that they all — men, women and children — ran out to see it, and cried to each other: ‘Look ! look ! behold a miracle ! Two ducks supporting a turtle ! Was ever such a thing known before !’ Indeed, so great was the surprise that men left their ploughing and women their weaving in order to add their voices to their friends’. The ducks flew steadily on, heeding nothing of the commotion below; but not so the turtle. At first he kept silence, as he had been bidden to do, but at length the clamour below proved too much for him, and he began to think that everyone was envying him the power of travelling through the air. In an evil moment he forgot the promises he had made so solemnly, and opened his mouth to reply, but, before he could utter a word, he was rushing so swiftly through the air that he quickly became unconscious, and in this state was dashed to pieces against the side of a house. Then the ducks let fall after him the stick that had held up their friend, and which was of no further use. Sadly they looked at each other arid shook their heads. ‘We feared it would end so,’ said they, ‘yet, perhaps, he was right after all. Certainly this death was better than the one which awaited him.’",India,,1488.0,1525

They had it all to themselves, except for a turtle, who was many years older than they were, and had come there before them, and, luckily, instead of taking a dislike to the turtle, as so often happens when you have only one person to speak to, they became great friends, and spent most of the day in each other’s company. All went on smoothly and happily till one summer, ‘when the rains failed and the sun shone so fiercely that every morning there was a little less water in the lake and a little more mud on the bank. The water-lilies around the edge began to droop, and the palms to hang their heads, and the ducks’ favourite swimming place, where they could dive the deepest, to grow shallower and shallower. At length there came a morning when the ducks looked at each other uneasily, and before nightfall they had whispered that if at the end of two days rain had not come, they must fly away and seek a new home, for if they stayed in their old one, which they loved so much, they would certainly die of thirst. Earnestly they watched the sky for many hours before they tucked their heads under their wings and fell asleep from sheer weariness, but not the tiniest cloud was to be seen covering the stars that shone so big and brilliant, and hung so low in the heavens that you felt as if you could touch them. So, when the morning broke, they made up their minds that they must go and tell the turtle of their plans, and bid him farewell. They found him comfortably curled up on a pile of dead rushes, more than half asleep, for he was old, and could not venture out in the heat as he once used. ‘Ah ! here you are,’ he cried; ‘I began to wonder if I was ever going to see you again, for, somehow, though the lake has grown smaller, I seem to have grown weaker, and it is lonely spending all day and night by oneself !’‘Oh ! my friend,’ answered the elder of the two ducks, ‘if you have suffered we have suffered also. Besides, I have something to tell you, that I fear will cause you greater pain still. If we do not wish to die of thirst we must leave this place at once, and seek another where the sun’s rays do not come. My heart bleeds to say this, for there is nothing — nothing else in the world — which would have induced us to separate from you.’The turtle was so astonished as well as so distressed at the duck’s speech that for a moment he could find no words to reply. But when he had forced back his tears, he said in a shaky voice: ‘How can you think that I am able to live without you, when for so long you have been my only friends ? If you leave me, death will speedily put an end to my grief.’‘Our sorrow is as great as yours,’ answered the other duck, ‘but what can we do ? And remember that if we are not here to drink the water, there will be the more for you ! If it had not been for this terrible misfortune, be sure that nothing would have parted us from one whom we love so dearly.’‘My friends,’ replied the turtle, ‘water is as necessary to me as to you, and if death stares in your faces, it stares in mine also. But in the name of all the years we have passed together, do not, I beseech you, leave me to perish here alone ! Wherever you may go take me with you !’There was a pause. The ducks felt wretched at the thought of abandoning their old comrade, yet, at the same time, how could they grant his prayer ? It seemed quite impossible, and at length one of them spoke: ‘Oh, how can I find words to refuse ?’ cried he, ‘yet how can we do what you ask ? Consider that, like yours, our bodies are heavy and our feet small. Therefore, how could we walk with you over mountains and deserts, till we reached a land where the sun’s rays no longer burn ? Why, before the day was out we should all three be dead of fatigue and hunger ! No, our only hope lies in our wings — and, alas ! you cannot fly !’‘No, I cannot fly, of course,’ answered the turtle, with a sigh. ‘But you are so clever, and have seen so much of the world – surely you can think of some plan ?’ And he fixed his eyes eagerly on them. Now, when the ducks saw how ardently the turtle wished to accompany them their hearts were touched, and making a sign to their friend that they wished to be alone they swam out into the lake to consult together.

You might walk from one end to the other without ever seeing a hare, or a deer, or a boar, or hearing the cooing of the doves in their nest. If they were not dead, they had flown elsewhere. Only three creatures remained alive, and they had hidden themselves in the thickest part of the forest, high up the mountain. These were a grey-furred, long-tailed tanuki, his wife the fox, who was one of his own family, and their little son. The fox and the tanuki were very clever, prudent beasts, and they also were skilled in magic, and by this means had escaped the fate of their unfortunate friends. If they heard the twang of an arrow or saw the glitter of a spear, ever so far off, they lay very still, and were not to be tempted from their hiding-place, if their hunger was ever so great, or the game ever so delicious. ‘We are not so foolish as to risk our lives,’ they said to each other proudly. But at length there came a day when, in spite of their prudence, they seemed likely to die of starvation, for no more food was to be had. Something had to be done, but they did not know what. Suddenly a bright thought struck the tanuki. ‘I have got a plan,’ he cried joyfully to his wife. ‘I will pretend to be dead, and you must change yourself into a man, and take me to the village for sale. It will be easy to find a buyer, tanukis’ skins are always wanted; then buy some food with the money and come home again. I will manage to escape somehow, so do not worry about me.’The fox laughed with delight, and rubbed her paws together with satisfaction. ‘Well, next time I will go,’ she said, ‘and you can sell me.’ And then she changed herself into a man, and picking up the stiff body of the tanuki, set off towards the village. She found him rather heavy, but it would never have done to let him walk through the wood and risk his being seen by somebody. As the tanaki had foretold, buyers were many, and the fox handed him over to the person who offered the largest price, and hurried to get some food with the money. The buyer took the tanuki back to his house, and throwing him into a corner went out. Directly the tanaki found he was alone, he crept cautiously through a chink of the window, thinking, as he did so, how lucky it was that he was not a fox, and was able to climb. Once outside, he hid himself in a ditch till it grew dusk, and then galloped away into the forest. While the food lasted they were all three as happy as kings; but there soon arrived a day when the larder was as empty as ever. ‘It is my turn now to pretend to be dead,’ cried the fox. So the tanuki changed himself into a peasant, and started for the village, with his wife’s body hanging over his shoulder. A buyer was not long in coming forward, and while they were making the bargain a wicked thought darted into the tanuki’s head, that if he got rid of the fox there would be more food for him and his son. So as he put the money in his pocket he whispered softly to the buyer that the fox was not really dead, and that if he did not take care she might run away from him. The man did not need twice telling. He gave the poor fox a blow on the head, which put an end to her, and the wicked tanuki went smiling to the nearest shop. In former times he had been very fond of his little son; but since he had betrayed his wife he seemed to have changed all in a moment, for he would not give him as much as a bite, and the poor little fellow would have starved had he not found some nuts and berries to eat, and he waited on, always hoping that his mother would come back. At length some notion of the truth began to dawn on him; but he was careful to let the old tanuki see nothing, though in his own mind he turned over plans from morning till night, wondering how best he might avenge his mother. One morning, as the little tanuki was sitting with his father, he remembered, with a start, that his mother had taught him all she knew of magic, and that he could work spells as well as his father, or perhaps better. ‘I am as good a wizard as you,’ he said suddenly, and a cold chill ran through the tanuki as he heard him, though he laughed, and pretended to think it a joke. But the little tanaki stuck to his point, and at last the father proposed they should have a wager. ‘Change yourself into any shape you like,’ said he, ‘and I will undertake to know you. I will go and wait on the bridge which leads over the river to the village, and you shall transform yourself into anything you please, but I will know you through any disguise.’ The little tanuki agreed, and went down the road which his father had pointed out. But instead of transforming himself into a different shape, he just hid himself in a corner of the bridge, where he could see without being seen. He had not been there long when his father arrived and took up his place near the middle of the bridge, and soon after the king came by, followed by a troop of guards and all his court. ‘Ah! he thinks that now he has changed himself into a king I shall not know him,’ thought the old tanuki, and as the king passed in his splendid carriage, borne by his servants, he jumped upon it crying: ‘I have won my wager; you cannot deceive me.’ But in reality it was he who had deceived himself. The soldiers, conceiving that their king was being attacked, seized the tanuki by the legs and flung him over into the river, and the water closed over him. And the little tanoki saw it all, and rejoiced that his mother’s death had been avenged. Then he went back to the forest, and if he has not found it too lonely, he is probably living there still.",Japan,,1668.0,1110

You might walk from one end to the other without ever seeing a hare, or a deer, or a boar, or hearing the cooing of the doves in their nest. If they were not dead, they had flown elsewhere. Only three creatures remained alive, and they had hidden themselves in the thickest part of the forest, high up the mountain. These were a grey-furred, long-tailed tanuki, his wife the fox, who was one of his own family, and their little son. The fox and the tanuki were very clever, prudent beasts, and they also were skilled in magic, and by this means had escaped the fate of their unfortunate friends. If they heard the twang of an arrow or saw the glitter of a spear, ever so far off, they lay very still, and were not to be tempted from their hiding-place, if their hunger was ever so great, or the game ever so delicious. ‘We are not so foolish as to risk our lives,’ they said to each other proudly. But at length there came a day when, in spite of their prudence, they seemed likely to die of starvation, for no more food was to be had. Something had to be done, but they did not know what. Suddenly a bright thought struck the tanuki. ‘I have got a plan,’ he cried joyfully to his wife. ‘I will pretend to be dead, and you must change yourself into a man, and take me to the village for sale. It will be easy to find a buyer, tanukis’ skins are always wanted; then buy some food with the money and come home again. I will manage to escape somehow, so do not worry about me.’The fox laughed with delight, and rubbed her paws together with satisfaction. ‘Well, next time I will go,’ she said, ‘and you can sell me.’ And then she changed herself into a man, and picking up the stiff body of the tanuki, set off towards the village. She found him rather heavy, but it would never have done to let him walk through the wood and risk his being seen by somebody. As the tanaki had foretold, buyers were many, and the fox handed him over to the person who offered the largest price, and hurried to get some food with the money. The buyer took the tanuki back to his house, and throwing him into a corner went out. Directly the tanaki found he was alone, he crept cautiously through a chink of the window, thinking, as he did so, how lucky it was that he was not a fox, and was able to climb. Once outside, he hid himself in a ditch till it grew dusk, and then galloped away into the forest. While the food lasted they were all three as happy as kings; but there soon arrived a day when the larder was as empty as ever. ‘It is my turn now to pretend to be dead,’ cried the fox. So the tanuki changed himself into a peasant, and started for the village, with his wife’s body hanging over his shoulder. A buyer was not long in coming forward, and while they were making the bargain a wicked thought darted into the tanuki’s head, that if he got rid of the fox there would be more food for him and his son. So as he put the money in his pocket he whispered softly to the buyer that the fox was not really dead, and that if he did not take care she might run away from him.

He was a very good man, and equally kind to all of them. His mother complained of nothing at his hands, but his wife was a very bad-tempered woman, and always troubled her mother-in-law by keeping her engaged in this work or that throughout the day, and giving her very little food in the evening. Owing to this the poor Brâhmaṇ’s mother was almost dying of misery. On the other hand, her own mother received very kind treatment, of course, at her daughter’s hands, but the husband was so completely ruled by his wife, that he had no strength of mind to oppose her ill-treatment of his mother. One evening, just before sunset, the wife abused her mother-in-law with such fury, that the latter had to fly away to escape a thrashing. Full of misery she ran out of the village, but the sun had begun to set, and the darkness of night was fast overtaking her. So finding a ruined temple she entered it to pass the night there. It happened to be the abode of the village Kâlî ( goddess), who used to come out every night at midnight to inspect her village. That night she perceived a woman—the mother of the poor Brâhmaṇ—lurking within her prâkâras ( boundaries), and being a most benevolent Kâlî, called out to her, and asked her what made her so miserable that she should leave her home on such a dark night. The Brâhmaṇî told her story in a few words, and while she was speaking the cunning goddess was using her supernatural powers to see whether all she said was true or not, and finding it to be the truth, she thus replied in very soothing tones:—“I pity your misery, mother, because your daughter-in-law troubles and vexes you thus when you have become old, and have no strength in your body. Now take this mango,” and taking a ripe one from out her waist-band, she gave it to the old Brâhmaṇî with a smiling face—“eat it, and you will soon become a young woman like your own daughter-in-law, and then she shall no longer trouble you.” Thus consoling the afflicted old woman, the kind-hearted Kâlî went away. The Brâhmaṇî lingered for the remainder of the night in the temple, and being a fond mother she did not like to eat the whole of the mango without giving a portion of it to her son. Meanwhile, when her son returned home in the evening he found his mother absent, but his wife explained the matter to him, so as to throw the blame on the old woman, as she always did. As it was dark he had no chance of going out to search for her, so he waited for the daylight, and as soon as he saw the dawn, started to look for his mother. He had not walked far when to his joy he found her in the temple of Kâlî. “How did you pass the cold night, my dearest mother?” said he. “What did you have for dinner? Wretch that I am to have got myself married to a cur. Forget all her faults, and return home.” His mother shed tears of joy and sorrow, and related her previous night’s adventure, upon which he said:—“Delay not even one nimisha ( minute), but eat this fruit at once. I do not want any of it. Only if you become young and strong enough to stand that nasty cur’s troubles, well and good.” So the mother ate up the divine fruit, and the son took her upon his shoulders and brought her home, on reaching which he placed her on the ground, when to his joy she was no longer an old woman, but a young girl of sixteen, and stronger than his own wife. The troublesome wife was now totally put down, and was powerless against so strong a mother-in-law. She did not at all like the change, and having to give up her habits of bullying, and so she argued to herself thus:—“This jade of a mother-in-law became young through the fruit of the Kâlî, why should not my mother also do the same, if I instruct her and send her to the same temple.” So she instructed her mother as to the story she ought to give to the goddess and sent her there. Her old mother, agreeably to her daughter’s injunctions, went to the temple, and on meeting with the goddess at midnight, gave a false story that she was being greatly ill-treated by her daughter-in-law, though, in truth, she had nothing of the kind to complain of. The goddess perceived the lie through her divine powers, but pretending to pity her, gave her also a fruit. Her daughter had instructed her not to eat it till next morning, and till she saw her son-in-law. As soon as morning approached, the poor hen-pecked Brâhmaṇ was ordered by his wife to go to the temple and fetch his mother-in-law, as he had some time back fetched away his mother. He accordingly went, and invited her to come home. She wanted him to eat part of the fruit, as she had been instructed, but he refused, and so she swallowed it all, fully expecting to become young again on reaching home. Meanwhile her son-in-law took her on his shoulders and returned home, expecting, as his former experience had taught him, to see his mother-in-law also turn into a young woman. Anxiety to see how the change came on over-came him, and half way he turned his head, and found such part of the burden on his shoulders as he could see, to be like parts of an ass, but he took this to be a mere preliminary stage towards youthful womanhood! Again he turned, and again he saw the same thing several times, and the more he looked the more his burden became like an ass, till at last when he reached home, his burden jumped down braying like an ass and ran away. Thus the Kâlî, perceiving the evil intentions of the wife, disappointed her by turning her mother into an ass, but no one knew of it till she actually jumped down from the shoulders of her son-in-law. This story is always cited as the explanation of the proverb quoted above—vara vara mâmi kaludai pôl ânâl—little by little the mother-in-law became an ass, to which is also commonly added ûr varumbôdu ûlaiyida talaippattal—and as she approached the village, she began to bray.",India,,2539.0,1140

Only if you become young and strong enough to stand that nasty cur’s troubles, well and good.” So the mother ate up the divine fruit, and the son took her upon his shoulders and brought her home, on reaching which he placed her on the ground, when to his joy she was no longer an old woman, but a young girl of sixteen, and stronger than his own wife. The troublesome wife was now totally put down, and was powerless against so strong a mother-in-law. She did not at all like the change, and having to give up her habits of bullying, and so she argued to herself thus:—“This jade of a mother-in-law became young through the fruit of the Kâlî, why should not my mother also do the same, if I instruct her and send her to the same temple.” So she instructed her mother as to the story she ought to give to the goddess and sent her there. Her old mother, agreeably to her daughter’s injunctions, went to the temple, and on meeting with the goddess at midnight, gave a false story that she was being greatly ill-treated by her daughter-in-law, though, in truth, she had nothing of the kind to complain of. The goddess perceived the lie through her divine powers, but pretending to pity her, gave her also a fruit. Her daughter had instructed her not to eat it till next morning, and till she saw her son-in-law. As soon as morning approached, the poor hen-pecked Brâhmaṇ was ordered by his wife to go to the temple and fetch his mother-in-law, as he had some time back fetched away his mother. He accordingly went, and invited her to come home. She wanted him to eat part of the fruit, as she had been instructed, but he refused, and so she swallowed it all, fully expecting to become young again on reaching home. Meanwhile her son-in-law took her on his shoulders and returned home, expecting, as his former experience had taught him, to see his mother-in-law also turn into a young woman. Anxiety to see how the change came on over-came him, and half way he turned his head, and found such part of the burden on his shoulders as he could see, to be like parts of an ass, but he took this to be a mere preliminary stage towards youthful womanhood! Again he turned, and again he saw the same thing several times, and the more he looked the more his burden became like an ass, till at last when he reached home, his burden jumped down braying like an ass and ran away. Thus the Kâlî, perceiving the evil intentions of the wife, disappointed her by turning her mother into an ass, but no one knew of it till she actually jumped down from the shoulders of her son-in-law. This story is always cited as the explanation of the proverb quoted above—vara vara mâmi kaludai pôl ânâl—little by little the mother-in-law became an ass, to which is also commonly added ûr varumbôdu ûlaiyida talaippattal—and as she approached the village, she began to bray.",India,,2539.0,1140

A dense forest lay all round the cottage, and there was hardly a path or a tree in the whole wood that was not familiar to the peasant from his boyhood. In one of his wanderings he had made friends with a hare, and many an hour the two passed together, when the man was resting by the roadside, eating his dinner. Now this strange friendship was observed by the Tanuki, a wicked, quarrelsome beast, who hated the peasant, and was never tired of doing him an ill turn. Again and again he had crept to the hut, and finding some choice morsel put away for the little hare, had either eaten it if he thought it nice, or trampled it to pieces so that no one else should get it, and at last the peasant lost patience, and made up his mind he would have the Tanuki’s blood. So for many days the man lay hidden, waiting for the Tanuki to come by, and when one morning he marched up the road thinking of nothing but the dinner he was going to steal, the peasant threw himself upon him and bound his four legs tightly, so that he could not move. Then he dragged his enemy joyfully to the house, feeling that at length he had got the better of the mischievous beast which had done him so many ill turns. ‘He shall pay for them with his skin,’ he said to his wife. ‘We will first kill him, and then cook him.’ So saying, he hanged the Tanuki, head downwards, to a beam, and went out to gather wood for a fire. Meanwhile the old woman was standing at the mortar pounding the rise that was to serve them for the week with a pestle that made her arms ache with its weight. Suddenly she heard something whining and weeping in the corner, and, stopping her work, she looked round to see what it was. That was all that the rascal wanted, and he put on directly his most humble air, and begged the woman in his softest voice to loosen his bonds, which her hurting him sorely. She was filled with pity for him, but did not dare to set him free, as she knew that her husband would be very angry. The Tanuki, however, did not despair, and seeing that her heart was softened, began his prayers anew. ‘He only asked to have his bonds taken from him,’ he said. ‘He would give his word not to attempt to escape, and if he was once set free he could soon pound her rice for her.’ ‘Then you can have a little rest,’ he went on, ‘for rice pounding is very tiring work, and not at all fit for weak women.’ These last words melted the good woman completely, and she unfastened the bonds that held him. Poor foolish creature! In one moment the Tanuki had seized her, stripped off all her clothes, and popped her in the mortar. In a few minutes more she was pounded as fine as the rice; and not content with that, the Tanuki placed a pot on the hearth and made ready to cook the peasant a dinner from the flesh of his own wife! When everything was complete he looked out of the door, and saw the old man coming from the forest carrying a large bundle of wood. Quick as lightning the Tanuki not only put on the woman’s clothes, but, as he was a magician, assumed her form as well. Then he took the wood, kindled the fire, and very soon set a large dinner before the old man, who was very hungry, and had forgotten for the moment all about his enemy. But when the Tanuki saw that he had eaten his fill and would be thinking about his prisoner, he hastily shook off the clothes behind a door and took his own shape. Then he said to the peasant, ‘You are a nice sort of person to seize animals and to talk of killing them! You are caught in your own net. It is your own wife that you have eaten, and if you want to find her bones you have only to look under the floor.’ With these words he turned and made for the forest. The old peasant grew cold with horror as he listened, and seemed frozen to the place where he stood. When he had recovered himself a little, he collected the bones of his dead wife, buried them in the garden, and swore over the grave to be avenged on the Tanuki. After everything was done he sat himself down in his lonely cottage and wept bitterly, and the bitterest thought of all was that he would never be able to forget that he had eaten his own wife. While he was thus weeping and wailing his friend the hare passed by, and, hearing the noise, pricked up his ears and soon recognised the old man’s voice. He wondered what had happened, and put his head in at the door and asked if anything was the matter. With tears and groans the peasant told him the whole dreadful story, and the hare, filled with anger and compassion, comforted him as best he could, and promised to help him in his revenge. ‘The false knave shall not go unpunished,’ said he. So the first thing he did was to search the house for materials to make an ointment, which he sprinkled plentifully with pepper and then put in his pocket. Next he took a hatchet, bade farewell to the old man, and departed to the forest. He bent his steps to the dwelling of the Tanuki and knocked at the door. The Tanuki, who had no cause to suspect the hare, was greatly pleased to see him, for he noticed the hatchet at once, and began to lay plots how to get hold of it. To do this he thought he had better offer to accompany the hare, which was exactly what the hare wished and expected, for he knew all the Tanuki’s cunning, and understood his little ways. So he accepted the rascal’s company with joy, and made himself very pleasant as they strolled along. When they were wandering in this manner through the forest the hare carelessly raised his hatchet in passing, and cut down some thick boughs that were hanging over the path, but at length, after cutting down a good big tree, which cost him many hard blows, he declared that it was too heavy for him to carry home, and he must just leave it where it was. This delighted the greedy Tanuki, who said that they would be no weight for him, so they collected the large branches, which the hare bound tightly on his back. Then he trotted gaily to the house, the hare following after with his lighter bundle. By this time the hare had decided what he would do, and as soon as they arrived, he quietly set on fire the wood on the back of the Tanuki. The Tanuki, who was busy with something else, observed nothing, and only called out to ask what was the meaning of the crackling that he heard. ‘It is just the rattle of the stones which are rolling down the side of the mountain,’ the hare said; and the Tanuki was content, and made no further remarks, never noticing that the noise really sprang from the burning boughs on his back, until his fur was in flames, and it was almost too late to put it out. Shrieking with pain, he let fall the burning wood from his back, and stamped and howled with agony. But the hare comforted him, and told him that he always carried with him an excellent plaster in case of need, which would bring him instant relief, and taking out his ointment he spread it on a leaf of bamboo, and laid it on the wound. No sooner did it touch him than the Tanuki leapt yelling into the air, and the hare laughed, and ran to tell his friend the peasant what a trick he had played on their enemy. But the old man shook his head sadly, for he knew that the villain was only crushed for the moment, and that he would shortly be revenging himself upon them. No, the only way every to get any peace and quiet was to render the Tanuki harmless for ever. Long did the old man and the hare puzzle together how this was to be done, and at last they decided that they would make two boats, a small one of wood and a large one of clay. Then they fell to work at once, and when the boats were ready and properly painted, the hare went to the Tanuki, who was still very ill, and invited him to a great fish-catching. The Tanuki was still feeling angry with the hare about the trick he had played him, but he was weak and very hungry, so he gladly accepted the proposal, and accompanied the hare to the bank of the river, where the two boats were moored, rocked by the waves. They both looked exactly alike, and the Tanuki only saw that one was bigger than the other, and would hold more fish, so he sprang into the large one, while the hare climbed into the one which was made of wood. They loosened their moorings, and made for the middle of the stream, and when they were at some distance from the bank, the hare took his oar, and struck such a heavy blow at the other boat, that it broke in two. The Tanuki fell straight into the water, and was held there by the hare till he was quite dead.

A dense forest lay all round the cottage, and there was hardly a path or a tree in the whole wood that was not familiar to the peasant from his boyhood. In one of his wanderings he had made friends with a hare, and many an hour the two passed together, when the man was resting by the roadside, eating his dinner. Now this strange friendship was observed by the Tanuki, a wicked, quarrelsome beast, who hated the peasant, and was never tired of doing him an ill turn. Again and again he had crept to the hut, and finding some choice morsel put away for the little hare, had either eaten it if he thought it nice, or trampled it to pieces so that no one else should get it, and at last the peasant lost patience, and made up his mind he would have the Tanuki’s blood. So for many days the man lay hidden, waiting for the Tanuki to come by, and when one morning he marched up the road thinking of nothing but the dinner he was going to steal, the peasant threw himself upon him and bound his four legs tightly, so that he could not move. Then he dragged his enemy joyfully to the house, feeling that at length he had got the better of the mischievous beast which had done him so many ill turns. ‘He shall pay for them with his skin,’ he said to his wife. ‘We will first kill him, and then cook him.’ So saying, he hanged the Tanuki, head downwards, to a beam, and went out to gather wood for a fire. Meanwhile the old woman was standing at the mortar pounding the rise that was to serve them for the week with a pestle that made her arms ache with its weight. Suddenly she heard something whining and weeping in the corner, and, stopping her work, she looked round to see what it was. That was all that the rascal wanted, and he put on directly his most humble air, and begged the woman in his softest voice to loosen his bonds, which her hurting him sorely. She was filled with pity for him, but did not dare to set him free, as she knew that her husband would be very angry. The Tanuki, however, did not despair, and seeing that her heart was softened, began his prayers anew. ‘He only asked to have his bonds taken from him,’ he said. ‘He would give his word not to attempt to escape, and if he was once set free he could soon pound her rice for her.’ ‘Then you can have a little rest,’ he went on, ‘for rice pounding is very tiring work, and not at all fit for weak women.’ These last words melted the good woman completely, and she unfastened the bonds that held him. Poor foolish creature! In one moment the Tanuki had seized her, stripped off all her clothes, and popped her in the mortar. In a few minutes more she was pounded as fine as the rice; and not content with that, the Tanuki placed a pot on the hearth and made ready to cook the peasant a dinner from the flesh of his own wife! When everything was complete he looked out of the door, and saw the old man coming from the forest carrying a large bundle of wood. Quick as lightning the Tanuki not only put on the woman’s clothes, but, as he was a magician, assumed her form as well. Then he took the wood, kindled the fire, and very soon set a large dinner before the old man, who was very hungry, and had forgotten for the moment all about his enemy. But when the Tanuki saw that he had eaten his fill and would be thinking about his prisoner, he hastily shook off the clothes behind a door and took his own shape. Then he said to the peasant, ‘You are a nice sort of person to seize animals and to talk of killing them! You are caught in your own net. It is your own wife that you have eaten, and if you want to find her bones you have only to look under the floor.’ With these words he turned and made for the forest. The old peasant grew cold with horror as he listened, and seemed frozen to the place where he stood. When he had recovered himself a little, he collected the bones of his dead wife, buried them in the garden, and swore over the grave to be avenged on the Tanuki. After everything was done he sat himself down in his lonely cottage and wept bitterly, and the bitterest thought of all was that he would never be able to forget that he had eaten his own wife. While he was thus weeping and wailing his friend the hare passed by, and, hearing the noise, pricked up his ears and soon recognised the old man’s voice. He wondered what had happened, and put his head in at the door and asked if anything was the matter. With tears and groans the peasant told him the whole dreadful story, and the hare, filled with anger and compassion, comforted him as best he could, and promised to help him in his revenge. ‘The false knave shall not go unpunished,’ said he. So the first thing he did was to search the house for materials to make an ointment, which he sprinkled plentifully with pepper and then put in his pocket. Next he took a hatchet, bade farewell to the old man, and departed to the forest. He bent his steps to the dwelling of the Tanuki and knocked at the door. The Tanuki, who had no cause to suspect the hare, was greatly pleased to see him, for he noticed the hatchet at once, and began to lay plots how to get hold of it. To do this he thought he had better offer to accompany the hare, which was exactly what the hare wished and expected, for he knew all the Tanuki’s cunning, and understood his little ways. So he accepted the rascal’s company with joy, and made himself very pleasant as they strolled along. When they were wandering in this manner through the forest the hare carelessly raised his hatchet in passing, and cut down some thick boughs that were hanging over the path, but at length, after cutting down a good big tree, which cost him many hard blows, he declared that it was too heavy for him to carry home, and he must just leave it where it was. This delighted the greedy Tanuki, who said that they would be no weight for him, so they collected the large branches, which the hare bound tightly on his back. Then he trotted gaily to the house, the hare following after with his lighter bundle. By this time the hare had decided what he would do, and as soon as they arrived, he quietly set on fire the wood on the back of the Tanuki. The Tanuki, who was busy with something else, observed nothing, and only called out to ask what was the meaning of the crackling that he heard. ‘It is just the rattle of the stones which are rolling down the side of the mountain,’ the hare said; and the Tanuki was content, and made no further remarks, never noticing that the noise really sprang from the burning boughs on his back, until his fur was in flames, and it was almost too late to put it out. Shrieking with pain, he let fall the burning wood from his back, and stamped and howled with agony. But the hare comforted him, and told him that he always carried with him an excellent plaster in case of need, which would bring him instant relief, and taking out his ointment he spread it on a leaf of bamboo, and laid it on the wound. No sooner did it touch him than the Tanuki leapt yelling into the air, and the hare laughed, and ran to tell his friend the peasant what a trick he had played on their enemy. But the old man shook his head sadly, for he knew that the villain was only crushed for the moment, and that he would shortly be revenging himself upon them. No, the only way every to get any peace and quiet was to render the Tanuki harmless for ever. Long did the old man and the hare puzzle together how this was to be done, and at last they decided that they would make two boats, a small one of wood and a large one of clay. Then they fell to work at once, and when the boats were ready and properly painted, the hare went to the Tanuki, who was still very ill, and invited him to a great fish-catching. The Tanuki was still feeling angry with the hare about the trick he had played him, but he was weak and very hungry, so he gladly accepted the proposal, and accompanied the hare to the bank of the river, where the two boats were moored, rocked by the waves. They both looked exactly alike, and the Tanuki only saw that one was bigger than the other, and would hold more fish, so he sprang into the large one, while the hare climbed into the one which was made of wood. They loosened their moorings, and made for the middle of the stream, and when they were at some distance from the bank, the hare took his oar, and struck such a heavy blow at the other boat, that it broke in two. The Tanuki fell straight into the water, and was held there by the hare till he was quite dead. Then he put the body in his boat and rowed to land, and told the old man that his enemy was dead at last. And the old man rejoiced that his wife was avenged, and he took the hare into his house, and they lived together all their days in peace and quietness upon the mountain.",Japan,,1261.0,1721

The best story is, however, how he once got hold of the Devil, and made a fool of him. The peasant had one day been working in his field, and as twilight had set in, was making ready for the journey home, when he saw a heap of burning coals in the middle of his field, and when, full of astonishment, he went up to it, a little black devil was sitting on the live coals. “Thou dost indeed sit upon a treasure!” said the peasant. “Yes, in truth,” replied the Devil, “on a treasure which contains more gold and silver than thou hast ever seen in thy life!” “The treasure lies in my field and belongs to me,” said the peasant. “It is thine,” answered the Devil, “if thou wilt for two years give me the half of everything thy field produces. Money I have enough of, but I have a desire for the fruits of the earth.” The peasant agreed to the bargain. “In order, however, that no dispute may arise about the division,” said he, “everything that is above ground shall belong to thee, and what is under the earth to me.” The Devil was quite satisfied with that, but the cunning peasant had sown turnips. Now when the time for harvest came, the Devil appeared and wanted to take away his crop; but he found nothing but the yellow withered leaves, while the peasant, full of delight, was digging up his turnips. “Thou hast had the best of it for once,” said the Devil, “but the next time that won’t do. What grows above ground shall be thine, and what is under it, mine.” “I am willing,” replied the peasant; but when the time came to sow, he did not again sow turnips, but wheat.

All lived in a state of prosperity for some time, but the entrance of Saturn into the Brâhmiṇ’s horoscope turned everything upside down. The once prosperous Brâhmiṇ became poor, and was reduced to go to the neighbouring woods to gather bamboo rice with which to feed his hungry family. One day while plucking the bamboo ears, he saw a bush close by in flames, in the midst of which was a serpent struggling for its life. The Brâhmiṇ at once ran to its rescue, and stretching towards it a long green stick the reptile crept on to it and escaped from the flames, and then spread its hood and with a hissing sound approached to sting its rescuer. The Brâhmiṇ began to weep and bewail his folly in having saved the ungrateful creature, at which the serpent asked him:—“O Brâhmiṇ, why do you weep?” Said the old man: “You now purpose to kill me; is this the reward for my having saved your life?” “True, you have rescued me from a terrible death, but how am I to appease my hunger?” replied the serpent. And quoth the Brâhmiṇ, “You speak of your hunger, but who is to feed my old wife and six hungry children at my house?” The serpent, seeing the anxiety of the Brâhmiṇ, emitted a precious gem from its hood, and bade him take it home and give it to his wife for household expenses, after which to return to the wood to be devoured. The old man agreed, and, solemnly promising to return without fail, went home. Having given the gem to his family, and told them of his pact with the serpent, the Brâhmiṇ went back to the wood. The serpent had meanwhile reflected upon its own base ingratitude. “Is it right,” said it to itself, “to kill him who saved me from the flames? No! I shall rather perish of hunger, if I cannot find a prey to-day, than slay my protector.” So when the old Brâhmiṇ appeared, true to his word, the serpent presented him with another valuable gem, and after expressing a wish that he should live long and happily with his wife and children, went its own way, while the Brâhmiṇ returned joyously to his home. “Even as the serpent purposed acting towards its benefactor,” continued the king, “so did I, in my rage, intend putting to death my faithful minister and the protector of my life, Bodhaditya; and to free myself from this grievous sin there is no penance I should not undergo.” Then king Alakesa ordered a thousand Brâhmiṇs to be fed every day during his life, and many rich gifts to be distributed in temples as atonement for his great error. And from that day Bodhaditya and his three colleagues enjoyed still more of the royal favour. With those four faithful ministers king Alakesa lived a most happy life and had a most prosperous reign.

They gained a frugal livelihood by cutting brushwood on the hill-side, and carrying it in bundles on their back to sell in the nearest market town; for they were too poor to own an ox. With the money thus received they bought rice and radishes, their daily food. Only once or twice a year, at New Year’s and on the mikado’s birthday, could they afford to treat themselves to a mess of bean-curd or fresh fish. Yet the old man was very fond of rice-wine, and every week bought a gourd full to keep his old blood warm. As the years rolled on the aged father’s limbs became so stiff that he was unable any longer to climb the mountains. So his son, now grown to be a sturdy man, cut nearly double the quantity of wood and thus kept the family larder full. The old man was so proud of his son that he daily stood at sunset in front of his rustic gate to welcome him back. And to see the old daddy and the young stripling remove their headkerchiefs, and bow with hands on knees in polite fashion, bending their backs and sucking in their breath, out of respect to each other, and to hear them inquiring after one another’s health, showering mutual compliments all the time, one would have thought they had not seen each other for eight years, instead of eight hours. One winter the snow fell long and thick, until all the ground in field and forest was covered several feet over. The bamboo branches bent with their weight of white, the pine boughs broke under their load, and even the stone idols along the wayside were covered up. At first, even with the hardest work, the young woodcutter could scarcely get and sell wood to buy enough food to keep them both alive. He often went hungry himself, so that his father might have his warm wine. One day he went by another path up one of the mountain dells with his rope basket strapped to his back, and the empty gourd-bottle at his belt. While gloomily grieving over his hard luck, the faint odor of rice-wine seemed borne on the breeze. He snuffed the air. It was no mistake. “Here’s luck, surely,” said he, throwing down his bundle. Hurrying forward he saw a foaming waterfall tumbling over the rocks in a thick stream. As he drew near, some of the spray fell on his tongue. He tasted it, smacked his lips and throwing down his cord and basket to the ground, filled his gourd and hastened home to his father. Every day, till the end of his father’s life, did he come to this wonderful cascade of wine, and thus the old man was nourished for many a long year. The news of this fountain of youth spread abroad until it reached the court. The mikado, hearing of it, made a journey to Mino to see the wonderful waterfall. In honor of this event, and as a reward of filial piety, the name of the year-period was changed to Yoro, ( Nourishing Old Age). To this day, many people young and old go out to enjoy picnic parties at the foot of the waterfall; which now, however, runs honest water only, which makes the cheeks red; and not the wonderful wine that once tipped the old daddy’s nose with perpetual vermilion.",Japan,,856.0,598

With the money thus received they bought rice and radishes, their daily food. Only once or twice a year, at New Year’s and on the mikado’s birthday, could they afford to treat themselves to a mess of bean-curd or fresh fish. Yet the old man was very fond of rice-wine, and every week bought a gourd full to keep his old blood warm. As the years rolled on the aged father’s limbs became so stiff that he was unable any longer to climb the mountains. So his son, now grown to be a sturdy man, cut nearly double the quantity of wood and thus kept the family larder full. The old man was so proud of his son that he daily stood at sunset in front of his rustic gate to welcome him back. And to see the old daddy and the young stripling remove their headkerchiefs, and bow with hands on knees in polite fashion, bending their backs and sucking in their breath, out of respect to each other, and to hear them inquiring after one another’s health, showering mutual compliments all the time, one would have thought they had not seen each other for eight years, instead of eight hours. One winter the snow fell long and thick, until all the ground in field and forest was covered several feet over. The bamboo branches bent with their weight of white, the pine boughs broke under their load, and even the stone idols along the wayside were covered up. At first, even with the hardest work, the young woodcutter could scarcely get and sell wood to buy enough food to keep them both alive. He often went hungry himself, so that his father might have his warm wine. One day he went by another path up one of the mountain dells with his rope basket strapped to his back, and the empty gourd-bottle at his belt. While gloomily grieving over his hard luck, the faint odor of rice-wine seemed borne on the breeze. He snuffed the air. It was no mistake. “Here’s luck, surely,” said he, throwing down his bundle. Hurrying forward he saw a foaming waterfall tumbling over the rocks in a thick stream. As he drew near, some of the spray fell on his tongue. He tasted it, smacked his lips and throwing down his cord and basket to the ground, filled his gourd and hastened home to his father. Every day, till the end of his father’s life, did he come to this wonderful cascade of wine, and thus the old man was nourished for many a long year. The news of this fountain of youth spread abroad until it reached the court. The mikado, hearing of it, made a journey to Mino to see the wonderful waterfall. In honor of this event, and as a reward of filial piety, the name of the year-period was changed to Yoro, ( Nourishing Old Age). To this day, many people young and old go out to enjoy picnic parties at the foot of the waterfall; which now, however, runs honest water only, which makes the cheeks red; and not the wonderful wine that once tipped the old daddy’s nose with perpetual vermilion.",Japan,,856.0,598

He was an honest old man, very poor and hard-working, and he lived with his good old wife in a cottage on the hills. Children they had none, and little comfort in their old age, poor souls. Také Tori rose early upon a summer morning, and went forth to cut bamboos as was his wont, for he sold them for a fair price in the town, and thus he gained his humble living. Up the steep hillside he went, and came to the bamboo grove quite wearied out. He took his blue tenegui and wiped his forehead, “Alack for my old bones!” he said. “I am not so young as I once was, nor the good wife either, and there’s no chick nor child to help us in our old age, more’s the pity.” He sighed as he got to work, poor Také Tori. Soon he saw a bright light shining among the green stems of the bamboos. “What is this?” said Také Tori, for as a rule it was dim and shady enough in the bamboo grove. “Is it the sun?” said Také Tori. “No, that cannot well be, for it comes from the ground.” Very soon he pushed his way through the bamboo stems to see what the bright light came from. Sure enough it came from the root of a great big green bamboo. Také Tori took his axe and cut down the great big green bamboo, and there was a fine shining green jewel, the size of his two fists. “Wonder of wonders!” cried Také Tori. “Wonder of wonders! For five-and-thirty years I’ve cut bamboo. This is the very first time I’ve found a great big green jewel at the root of one of them.” With that he takes up the jewel in his hands, and as soon as he does that, it bursts in two with a loud noise, if you’ll believe it, and out of it came a young person and stood on Také Tori’s hand. You must understand the young person was small but very beautiful. She was dressed all in green silk. “Greetings to you, Také Tori,” she says, as easy as you please. “Mercy me!” says Také Tori. “Thank you kindly. I suppose, now, you’ll be a fairy,” he says, “if I’m not making too bold in asking?” “You’re right,” she says, “it’s a fairy I am, and I’m come to live with you and your good wife for a little.” “Well, now,” says Také Tori, “begging your pardon, we’re very poor. Our cottage is good enough, but I’m afraid there’d be no comforts for a lady like you.” “Where’s the big green jewel?” says the fairy. Take Tori picks up the two halves. “Why, it’s full of gold pieces,” he says. “That will do to go on with,” says the fairy; “and now, Také Tori, let us make for home.” Home they went. “Wife! wife!” cried Také Tori, “here’s a fairy come to live with us, and she has brought us a shining jewel as big as a persimmon, full of gold pieces.” The good wife came running to the door. She could hardly believe her eyes. “What is this,” she said, “about a persimmon and gold pieces? Persimmons I have seen often enough—moreover, it is the season—but gold pieces are hard to come by.” “Let be, woman,” said Také Tori, “you are dull.” And he brought the fairy into the house. Wondrous fast the fairy grew. Before many days were gone she was a fine tall maiden, as fresh and as fair as the morning, as bright as the noonday, as sweet and still as the evening, and as deep as the night. Také Tori called her the Lady Beaming Bright, because she had come out of the shining jewel. Take Tori had the gold pieces out of the jewel every day. He grew rich, and spent his money like a man, but there was always plenty and to spare. He built him a fine house, he had servants to wait on him. The Lady Beaming Bright was lodged like an empress. Her beauty was famed both near and far, and scores of lovers came to seek her hand. But she would have none of them. “Také Tori and the dear good wife are my true lovers,” she said; “I will live with them and be their daughter.” So three happy years went by; and in the third year the Mikado himself came to woo the Lady Beaming Bright. He was the brave lover, indeed. “Lady,” he said, “I bow before you, my soul salutes you. Sweet lady, be my Queen.” Then the Lady Beaming Bright sighed and great tears stood in her eyes, and she hid her face with her sleeve. “Lord, I cannot,” she said. “Cannot?” said the Mikado; “and why not, O dear Lady Beaming Bright?” “Wait and see, lord,” she said. Now about the seventh month she grew very sorrowful, and would go abroad no more, but was for long upon the garden gallery of Také Tori’s house. There she sat in the daytime and brooded. There she sat at night and gazed upon the moon and the stars. There she was one fine night when the moon was at its full. Her maidens were with her, and Také Tori and the good wife, and the Mikado, her brave lover. “How bright the moon shines!” said Také Tori. “Truly,” said the good wife, “it is like a brass saucepan well scoured.” “See how pale and wan it is,” said the Mikado; “it is like a sad despairing lover.” “How long and bright a beam!” quoth Také Tori. “It is like a highway from the moon reaching to this garden gallery.” “O dear foster-father,” cried the Lady Beaming Bright. “You speak truth, it is a highway indeed. And along the highway come countless heavenly beings swiftly, swiftly, to bear me home. My father is the King of the Moon. I disobeyed his behest. He sent me to earth three years to dwell in exile. The three years are past and I go to mine own country. Ah, I am sad at parting.” “The mist descends,” said Také Tori. “Nay,” said the Mikado, “it is the cohorts of the King of the Moon.” Down they came in their hundreds and their thousands, bearing torches. Silently they came, and lighted round about the garden gallery. The chief among them brought a heavenly feather robe. Up rose the Lady Beaming Bright and put the robe upon her. “Farewell, Také Tori,” she said, “farewell, dear foster-mother, I leave you my jewel for a remembrance…. As for you, my lord, I would you might come with me—but there is no feather robe for you. I leave you a phial of the pure elixir of life. Drink, my lord, and be even as the Immortals.” Then she spread her bright wings and the cohorts of Heaven closed about her. Together they passed up the highway to the moon, and were no more seen. The Mikado took the elixir of life in his hand, and he went to the top of the highest mountain in that country. And he made a great fire to consume the elixir of life, for he said, “Of what profit shall it be to me to live for ever, being parted from the Lady Beaming Bright?” So the elixir of life was consumed, and its blue vapour floated up to Heaven. And the Mikado said, “Let my message float up with the vapour and reach the ears of my Lady Beaming Bright.”",Japan,,646.0,1273

He took his blue tenegui and wiped his forehead, “Alack for my old bones!” he said. “I am not so young as I once was, nor the good wife either, and there’s no chick nor child to help us in our old age, more’s the pity.” He sighed as he got to work, poor Také Tori. Soon he saw a bright light shining among the green stems of the bamboos. “What is this?” said Také Tori, for as a rule it was dim and shady enough in the bamboo grove. “Is it the sun?” said Také Tori. “No, that cannot well be, for it comes from the ground.” Very soon he pushed his way through the bamboo stems to see what the bright light came from. Sure enough it came from the root of a great big green bamboo. Také Tori took his axe and cut down the great big green bamboo, and there was a fine shining green jewel, the size of his two fists. “Wonder of wonders!” cried Také Tori. “Wonder of wonders! For five-and-thirty years I’ve cut bamboo. This is the very first time I’ve found a great big green jewel at the root of one of them.” With that he takes up the jewel in his hands, and as soon as he does that, it bursts in two with a loud noise, if you’ll believe it, and out of it came a young person and stood on Také Tori’s hand. You must understand the young person was small but very beautiful. She was dressed all in green silk. “Greetings to you, Také Tori,” she says, as easy as you please. “Mercy me!” says Také Tori. “Thank you kindly. I suppose, now, you’ll be a fairy,” he says, “if I’m not making too bold in asking?” “You’re right,” she says, “it’s a fairy I am, and I’m come to live with you and your good wife for a little.” “Well, now,” says Také Tori, “begging your pardon, we’re very poor. Our cottage is good enough, but I’m afraid there’d be no comforts for a lady like you.” “Where’s the big green jewel?” says the fairy. Take Tori picks up the two halves. “Why, it’s full of gold pieces,” he says. “That will do to go on with,” says the fairy; “and now, Také Tori, let us make for home.” Home they went. “Wife! wife!” cried Také Tori, “here’s a fairy come to live with us, and she has brought us a shining jewel as big as a persimmon, full of gold pieces.” The good wife came running to the door. She could hardly believe her eyes. “What is this,” she said, “about a persimmon and gold pieces? Persimmons I have seen often enough—moreover, it is the season—but gold pieces are hard to come by.” “Let be, woman,” said Také Tori, “you are dull.” And he brought the fairy into the house. Wondrous fast the fairy grew. Before many days were gone she was a fine tall maiden, as fresh and as fair as the morning, as bright as the noonday, as sweet and still as the evening, and as deep as the night. Také Tori called her the Lady Beaming Bright, because she had come out of the shining jewel. Take Tori had the gold pieces out of the jewel every day. He grew rich, and spent his money like a man, but there was always plenty and to spare. He built him a fine house, he had servants to wait on him. The Lady Beaming Bright was lodged like an empress. Her beauty was famed both near and far, and scores of lovers came to seek her hand. But she would have none of them. “Také Tori and the dear good wife are my true lovers,” she said; “I will live with them and be their daughter.” So three happy years went by; and in the third year the Mikado himself came to woo the Lady Beaming Bright. He was the brave lover, indeed. “Lady,” he said, “I bow before you, my soul salutes you. Sweet lady, be my Queen.” Then the Lady Beaming Bright sighed and great tears stood in her eyes, and she hid her face with her sleeve. “Lord, I cannot,” she said. “Cannot?” said the Mikado; “and why not, O dear Lady Beaming Bright?” “Wait and see, lord,” she said. Now about the seventh month she grew very sorrowful, and would go abroad no more, but was for long upon the garden gallery of Také Tori’s house. There she sat in the daytime and brooded. There she sat at night and gazed upon the moon and the stars. There she was one fine night when the moon was at its full. Her maidens were with her, and Také Tori and the good wife, and the Mikado, her brave lover. “How bright the moon shines!” said Také Tori. “Truly,” said the good wife, “it is like a brass saucepan well scoured.” “See how pale and wan it is,” said the Mikado; “it is like a sad despairing lover.” “How long and bright a beam!” quoth Také Tori. “It is like a highway from the moon reaching to this garden gallery.” “O dear foster-father,” cried the Lady Beaming Bright. “You speak truth, it is a highway indeed. And along the highway come countless heavenly beings swiftly, swiftly, to bear me home. My father is the King of the Moon. I disobeyed his behest. He sent me to earth three years to dwell in exile. The three years are past and I go to mine own country. Ah, I am sad at parting.” “The mist descends,” said Také Tori. “Nay,” said the Mikado, “it is the cohorts of the King of the Moon.” Down they came in their hundreds and their thousands, bearing torches. Silently they came, and lighted round about the garden gallery. The chief among them brought a heavenly feather robe. Up rose the Lady Beaming Bright and put the robe upon her. “Farewell, Také Tori,” she said, “farewell, dear foster-mother, I leave you my jewel for a remembrance…. As for you, my lord, I would you might come with me—but there is no feather robe for you. I leave you a phial of the pure elixir of life. Drink, my lord, and be even as the Immortals.” Then she spread her bright wings and the cohorts of Heaven closed about her. Together they passed up the highway to the moon, and were no more seen. The Mikado took the elixir of life in his hand, and he went to the top of the highest mountain in that country. And he made a great fire to consume the elixir of life, for he said, “Of what profit shall it be to me to live for ever, being parted from the Lady Beaming Bright?” So the elixir of life was consumed, and its blue vapour floated up to Heaven. And the Mikado said, “Let my message float up with the vapour and reach the ears of my Lady Beaming Bright.”",Japan,,646.0,1273

Adrian travels to Washington DC and gives a report on the findings to White House Chief of Staff Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt) who takes Adrian to meet the President of the United States. In 2010, President Thomas Wilson (Danny Glover) and other international leaders begin a secret project to ensure humanity's survival. Approximately 400,000 people are chosen to board ships that are being constructed at Cho Ming, Tibet, in the Himalayas. At the same time as the People's Liberation Army are gathering volunteers, a Buddhist monk named Nima (Osric Chau) is evacuated while his brother Tenzin (Chin Han) joins the workers in the ship project. Additional funding for the project is raised by selling tickets to the private sector for one billion euros per person. By 2011, humanity's valuable treasures are moved to the Himalayas under the guise of protecting them from terrorist attacks with the help of art expert and First Daughter Dr. Laura Wilson (Thandie Newton). One of the artworks is the Mona Lisa, which is replaced in the Louvre with a precise copy. Her boss, Roland Picard (Patrick Bauchau) is later killed when his car is forced into a fatal auto accident in the same Paris underpass where Princess Diana was killed. Picard had discovered that the cave containing the vault where the Mona Lisa & other precious works of art were supposed to be stored was a fake location. In 2012, Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) is a science fiction writer in Los Angeles who works part-time as a limousine driver for the Russian oligarch billionaire, Yuri Karpov (Zlatko Buri). Jackson's ex-wife, Kate (Amanda Peet) and their children Noah (Liam James) and Lilly (Morgan Lily) live with Kate's boyfriend, plastic surgeon Gordon Silberman (Thomas McCarthy). Jackson takes Noah and Lilly camping in Yellowstone National Park. After an encounter at a restricted government research site with Helmsley, they meet Charlie Frost (Woody Harrelson), who hosts a radio show from the park. Charlie, a conspiracy theorist, plays a video of Charles Hapgood's theory that polar shifts and the Mesoamerican Long Count Calendar predict that the 2012 phenomenon will occur. Hapgood believed that unstable conditions under the crust of the Earth would cause it to shift -- Earth crust displacement. Charlie has a map of the ark project in addition to conspiracy-theory information about officials and scientists from around the world who were murdered after planning to alert the public. One such scientist was a fan of Charlie's & had sent him the map before his untimely death. The family returns home as seismic activity vastly increases along the west coast of the United States. After dropping off Karpov's bratty sons at the airport, Jackson grows suspicious and rents a plane to rescue his family. He collects his family and Gordon as the Earth crust displacement begins, and they narrowly escape Los Angeles as the city slips into the Pacific Ocean, racked by a massive earthquake that destroys all of downtown. As millions die in catastrophic earthquakes worldwide, the group, with Gordon piloting the small plane, flies to Yellowstone to retrieve Charlie's map, escaping as the Yellowstone Caldera erupts. Charlie stays behind to broadcast the eruption and is killed in the blast of the expulsion of an ash cloud. Learning that the ships are in China, the group lands in a devastated Las Vegas to find a larger plane. They meet Yuri, his twin sons Alec and Oleg (played by Alexandre and Philippe Haussmann), girlfriend Tamara (Beatrice Rosen) and pilot Sasha (Johann Urb). The group secures an Antonov An-225 aircraft (erroneously and perhaps deliberately marked an ""Antonov 500"") and they depart for China. Also heading for the Cho Ming site aboard Air Force One are Anheuser, Helmsley and Laura Wilson. Upon arriving in Tibet, they find that the ships are not ships destined to take the survivors off Earth but are giant seagoing ships, large arks that can hold thousands of people. Helmsley finds that the cabins are actually quite luxurious and only meant for 1-2 people, a fact he criticizes when he tells his porter the room could hold about 10 people. Anheuser explains that the high price of a room was necessary to fund the project since the governments of the world couldn't possibly have hidden the cost for very long. President Wilson remains in Washington, D.C. to address the nation one last time. With the Vice President dead and the Speaker of the House missing, Anheuser assumes de facto leadership. Washington is hit by the pyroclastic ejecta cloud from Yellowstone, which covers the city in a choking cloud of thick ash. Struggling with others in the devastation, President Wilson is killed by a megatsunami which carries the aircraft carrier John F Kennedy into the White House, crushing it. Sasha and the group plan to land briefly at Hawaii to refuel, however, the island chain has been devastated by volcanic activity. Continuing on, Sasha fears they may run out of fuel before making it to mainland Asia. They discover that the seismic activity of the Earth's surface has shifted the Chinese coast 1500 miles east and they are able to make a crash landing, narrowly escaping death by driving a Bentley out of the plane before it skids to a stop on a glacier. The plane overbalances on the edge of a cliff and plummets, taking Sasha with it. The group is spotted by the People's Liberation Army. Yuri and his sons, possessing tickets, are taken to the arks, Yuri coldly leaving Tamara (whose affair with Sasha was something he knew of) and the others behind. They remaining survivors are picked up by Nima and are taken to the arks with his grandparents (Lisa Lu and Chang Tseng). They stow away on the ark with the help of Tenzin, who had a plan to smuggle his family aboard through a rear entrance. As a megatsunami approaches the site, an impact driver becomes lodged between the gears of the ark's hydraulics chamber, preventing a boarding gate from closing and rendering the ship unable to start its engines. In the ensuing chaos, Yuri, Gordon and Tamara are killed, Tenzin is wounded, and the ark is set adrift. Just before he dies, Yuri is able hoist both his sons up to crew members of the ship; in doing so, he jumps to his death. Jackson and Noah dislodge the impact driver and the crew regains control of the ark before it can impact Mount Everest. After flood waters from the tsunamis recede, the arks travel to the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa where the Drakensberg Mountains have risen in relation to sea level and become the tallest mountain range on Earth.",United States,,2655.0,1149

Adrian travels to Washington DC and gives a report on the findings to White House Chief of Staff Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt) who takes Adrian to meet the President of the United States. In 2010, President Thomas Wilson (Danny Glover) and other international leaders begin a secret project to ensure humanity's survival. Approximately 400,000 people are chosen to board ships that are being constructed at Cho Ming, Tibet, in the Himalayas. At the same time as the People's Liberation Army are gathering volunteers, a Buddhist monk named Nima (Osric Chau) is evacuated while his brother Tenzin (Chin Han) joins the workers in the ship project. Additional funding for the project is raised by selling tickets to the private sector for one billion euros per person. By 2011, humanity's valuable treasures are moved to the Himalayas under the guise of protecting them from terrorist attacks with the help of art expert and First Daughter Dr. Laura Wilson (Thandie Newton). One of the artworks is the Mona Lisa, which is replaced in the Louvre with a precise copy. Her boss, Roland Picard (Patrick Bauchau) is later killed when his car is forced into a fatal auto accident in the same Paris underpass where Princess Diana was killed. Picard had discovered that the cave containing the vault where the Mona Lisa & other precious works of art were supposed to be stored was a fake location. In 2012, Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) is a science fiction writer in Los Angeles who works part-time as a limousine driver for the Russian oligarch billionaire, Yuri Karpov (Zlatko Buri). Jackson's ex-wife, Kate (Amanda Peet) and their children Noah (Liam James) and Lilly (Morgan Lily) live with Kate's boyfriend, plastic surgeon Gordon Silberman (Thomas McCarthy). Jackson takes Noah and Lilly camping in Yellowstone National Park. After an encounter at a restricted government research site with Helmsley, they meet Charlie Frost (Woody Harrelson), who hosts a radio show from the park. Charlie, a conspiracy theorist, plays a video of Charles Hapgood's theory that polar shifts and the Mesoamerican Long Count Calendar predict that the 2012 phenomenon will occur. Hapgood believed that unstable conditions under the crust of the Earth would cause it to shift -- Earth crust displacement. Charlie has a map of the ark project in addition to conspiracy-theory information about officials and scientists from around the world who were murdered after planning to alert the public. One such scientist was a fan of Charlie's & had sent him the map before his untimely death. The family returns home as seismic activity vastly increases along the west coast of the United States. After dropping off Karpov's bratty sons at the airport, Jackson grows suspicious and rents a plane to rescue his family. He collects his family and Gordon as the Earth crust displacement begins, and they narrowly escape Los Angeles as the city slips into the Pacific Ocean, racked by a massive earthquake that destroys all of downtown. As millions die in catastrophic earthquakes worldwide, the group, with Gordon piloting the small plane, flies to Yellowstone to retrieve Charlie's map, escaping as the Yellowstone Caldera erupts. Charlie stays behind to broadcast the eruption and is killed in the blast of the expulsion of an ash cloud. Learning that the ships are in China, the group lands in a devastated Las Vegas to find a larger plane. They meet Yuri, his twin sons Alec and Oleg (played by Alexandre and Philippe Haussmann), girlfriend Tamara (Beatrice Rosen) and pilot Sasha (Johann Urb). The group secures an Antonov An-225 aircraft (erroneously and perhaps deliberately marked an ""Antonov 500"") and they depart for China. Also heading for the Cho Ming site aboard Air Force One are Anheuser, Helmsley and Laura Wilson. Upon arriving in Tibet, they find that the ships are not ships destined to take the survivors off Earth but are giant seagoing ships, large arks that can hold thousands of people. Helmsley finds that the cabins are actually quite luxurious and only meant for 1-2 people, a fact he criticizes when he tells his porter the room could hold about 10 people. Anheuser explains that the high price of a room was necessary to fund the project since the governments of the world couldn't possibly have hidden the cost for very long. President Wilson remains in Washington, D.C. to address the nation one last time. With the Vice President dead and the Speaker of the House missing, Anheuser assumes de facto leadership. Washington is hit by the pyroclastic ejecta cloud from Yellowstone, which covers the city in a choking cloud of thick ash. Struggling with others in the devastation, President Wilson is killed by a megatsunami which carries the aircraft carrier John F Kennedy into the White House, crushing it. Sasha and the group plan to land briefly at Hawaii to refuel, however, the island chain has been devastated by volcanic activity. Continuing on, Sasha fears they may run out of fuel before making it to mainland Asia. They discover that the seismic activity of the Earth's surface has shifted the Chinese coast 1500 miles east and they are able to make a crash landing, narrowly escaping death by driving a Bentley out of the plane before it skids to a stop on a glacier. The plane overbalances on the edge of a cliff and plummets, taking Sasha with it. The group is spotted by the People's Liberation Army. Yuri and his sons, possessing tickets, are taken to the arks, Yuri coldly leaving Tamara (whose affair with Sasha was something he knew of) and the others behind. They remaining survivors are picked up by Nima and are taken to the arks with his grandparents (Lisa Lu and Chang Tseng). They stow away on the ark with the help of Tenzin, who had a plan to smuggle his family aboard through a rear entrance. As a megatsunami approaches the site, an impact driver becomes lodged between the gears of the ark's hydraulics chamber, preventing a boarding gate from closing and rendering the ship unable to start its engines. In the ensuing chaos, Yuri, Gordon and Tamara are killed, Tenzin is wounded, and the ark is set adrift. Just before he dies, Yuri is able hoist both his sons up to crew members of the ship; in doing so, he jumps to his death. Jackson and Noah dislodge the impact driver and the crew regains control of the ark before it can impact Mount Everest. After flood waters from the tsunamis recede, the arks travel to the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa where the Drakensberg Mountains have risen in relation to sea level and become the tallest mountain range on Earth.",United States,,2655.0,1149

George Bryan Brummell. When the prince pays his compliments, Brummell responds with suggestions for improving the design of the regiment's uniforms, and George, who designed the uniforms himself, is offended. Brummell, a man of exacting sartorial and Epicurean tastes, is unfazed by the prince's disapproval, and makes an appearance that evening, wearing daring stove pipe pants, at a regimental dinner. There he meets the beautiful Lady Patricia Belham, the intended of George's political advisor, Lord Edwin Mercer. When Brummell refuses to retract his criticism of the uniforms, the prince discharges him from the service. Late that night, as Brummell watches his regiment embark on an overseas assignment, Patricia approaches him and asks why he is willing to sacrifice his military career. The proud Brummell explains that he is unwilling to compromise his dignity and self-respect, and impulsively kisses her. Brummell is left with no clear course for the future, however, as he has neither family name nor fortune. While strolling through town one day with his loyal valet Mortimer, Brummell sees politician Sir Ralph Sidley addressing a crowd. Brummell interrupts Sidley's speech with some sharply worded comments about the prince, and a newspaper reporter invites him to repeat his opinions the following evening at a civic meeting. Brummell accepts, and quickly makes a name for himself with his stinging indictment of the prince's excesses. Later, George is urged by Mercer and his prime minister, William Pitt, to end his relationship with his widowed, Catholic lover, Mrs. Maria Anne Fitzherbert, and make an advantageous marriage. Brummell is summoned by the prince, and as he urges George to stand up to Pitt, a bond begins to grow between the two men. One evening, when Brummell returns from the prince's birthday party, Mortimer warns him that his numerous creditors are growing impatient and suggests they go abroad. Brummell, who has become George's close friend and confidant, refuses, insisting that the prince needs him. Patricia drops by, and after Brummell shows her his exquisitely furnished house, they admit their strong feelings for each other. Patricia considers him too unstable to be a good candidate for marriage, however, and Brummell soon learns that her engagement to Mercer will be announced at an upcoming hunting party. Brummell is present at the gathering, and the prince publicly praises him for his devotion, promising to make Brummell an earl when he becomes king. While the other guests are fox hunting, Brummell and Patricia find themselves alone in the woods, and they fall into a passionate embrace. After the hunt, Mercer brusquely tells Patricia they should cancel their engagement, but she promises never to see Brummell again. The following morning, the distraught prince tells Brummell that Mrs. Fitzherbert is planning to leave for Italy. Brummell tells the prince that Pitt has been concealing the fact that King George III has gone mad.

George Bryan Brummell. When the prince pays his compliments, Brummell responds with suggestions for improving the design of the regiment's uniforms, and George, who designed the uniforms himself, is offended. Brummell, a man of exacting sartorial and Epicurean tastes, is unfazed by the prince's disapproval, and makes an appearance that evening, wearing daring stove pipe pants, at a regimental dinner. There he meets the beautiful Lady Patricia Belham, the intended of George's political advisor, Lord Edwin Mercer. When Brummell refuses to retract his criticism of the uniforms, the prince discharges him from the service. Late that night, as Brummell watches his regiment embark on an overseas assignment, Patricia approaches him and asks why he is willing to sacrifice his military career. The proud Brummell explains that he is unwilling to compromise his dignity and self-respect, and impulsively kisses her. Brummell is left with no clear course for the future, however, as he has neither family name nor fortune. While strolling through town one day with his loyal valet Mortimer, Brummell sees politician Sir Ralph Sidley addressing a crowd. Brummell interrupts Sidley's speech with some sharply worded comments about the prince, and a newspaper reporter invites him to repeat his opinions the following evening at a civic meeting. Brummell accepts, and quickly makes a name for himself with his stinging indictment of the prince's excesses. Later, George is urged by Mercer and his prime minister, William Pitt, to end his relationship with his widowed, Catholic lover, Mrs. Maria Anne Fitzherbert, and make an advantageous marriage. Brummell is summoned by the prince, and as he urges George to stand up to Pitt, a bond begins to grow between the two men. One evening, when Brummell returns from the prince's birthday party, Mortimer warns him that his numerous creditors are growing impatient and suggests they go abroad. Brummell, who has become George's close friend and confidant, refuses, insisting that the prince needs him. Patricia drops by, and after Brummell shows her his exquisitely furnished house, they admit their strong feelings for each other. Patricia considers him too unstable to be a good candidate for marriage, however, and Brummell soon learns that her engagement to Mercer will be announced at an upcoming hunting party. Brummell is present at the gathering, and the prince publicly praises him for his devotion, promising to make Brummell an earl when he becomes king. While the other guests are fox hunting, Brummell and Patricia find themselves alone in the woods, and they fall into a passionate embrace.

O'Hara brings her coffee, without even slowing down. Jackie goes to a 7-year-old boy being wheeled in. Cooper dances by the mom, excited that he gets to treat a gunshot. Zoey tries to cover for his medical exuberance in the face of tragedy. Jackie and Elenor treat the boy, inserting a chest tube to drain blood. Mo Mo holds the boy's hand, telling him to hang in there. Dr. O'Hara tells the mom her son's lung collapsed. She rattles off other possible problems, including brain damage, spinal cord issues... Jackie winces at her bluntness. Zoey hugs the mom. Jackie talks to her husband. They have some sort of parent-teacher conference they have to go to. But first, Jackie stares at powder in the bathroom. But it's just face powder. She runs into Eddie in the hallway. He offers her a ride. Thanks, but no thanks. She puts on her wedding ring as she walks away. Zoey and Mo Mo watch the mom and her son, the twin of the victim. Mo Mo says he was a twin, but his brother died when they were one. Jackie meets her husband at the school. She shows him the socks she bought him on the street. Her phone rings. She grimaces. It's Eddie. She tells her husband she just lost a patient. They meet with three people, the school nurse and psychologist along with the teacher. They think their daughter has an anxiety disorder. Their youngest walks by the open door and waves. She sees Grace in the hall and tells her their parents are there. Grace is concerned. Dr. O'Hara tells the twins' mom that her son is doing very well. She goes to see him and her other son wraps O'Hara in an immobilizing tiny bear hug. Jackie and her husband check out Grace's drawing. They're impressed with it, but the teacher points out it has no color. They ask if there are problems at home. The staff tells them Grace circles her desk three times before she sits down, so the planes don't fall out of the sky. They suggest she see a shrink and get on a low-dose anxiety medicine. Grace walks in, looking glum. Jackie follows the nurse into the hall. She apologizes, but asks if they're maybe going overboard. The counselor says it's a big deal. Outside, Jackie and her husband try to figure out what to do. Jackie thinks she watches too much news. They discuss private school. They don't end up arguing. Jackie asks him to make tacos for dinner. Jackie's phone beeps. It's Eddie saying he's horny. She looks at the message over her husband's shoulder while hugging him. She buys a disposable cell phone and gives Eddie the number when she gets back. He gives her pills. Zoey whines about being shut out of the interesting cases and Jackie leaves her with an old woman. Cooper drops by and smooth talks the patient. Jackie watches, impressed. O'Hara gives Jackie grief over leaving her alone with the kid and his sticky fingered gratitude. He brings her a drawing and she does her best to seem appreciative. Jackie looks at it, it's full of bright colors and sunshine. Jackie hears a beep and finds that Zoey's old woman has died. She tells her it's never easy, and when it is, it's time to quit. Both of Jackie's cell phones start ringing as she tries to have a somber moment at a dead patient's bedside. She answers both with a ""can't talk, love ya."" Cooper walks by, loudly celebrating his exciting gun shot wound victim. Zoey wants to put eyebrows on the elderly woman, who worried before about not being made up. Mo Mo sings to the injured twin at his bedside. Jackie looks at her daughter's gray drawing.

To commiserate, Max drinks with Howard at a couple of New York City bars, and toward the end of the night, Howard drunkenly suggests that shooting himself during his broadcast might improve ratings. The equally inebriated Max jokingly adds that real-life murder and mayhem might improve the entire network's ratings. The next evening, during his broadcast, Howard announces his upcoming retirement, and since he has nothing else in his life, he will ""blow his brains out"" on next Tuesday's show. The comment creates a media flurry, and UBS executive Frank Hackett takes Howard off the air. The next day, Howard calls Max to apologize and ask if he can return to his show that night to say goodbye. Later, Los Angeles, California, news liaison Bill Herron shows Max and Diana Christensen, the head of UBS programming, film footage of a bank robbery taken by an African American revolutionary group, the Ecumenical Liberation Army (ELA). Herron tells them that his contact, Laureen Hobbs, a black U.S. Communist Party official, is in communication with the ELA and can supply the network with more crime footage. Though Max sees no news value in the film, Diana thinks UBS could build a new ""movie of the week"" around the ELA by mixing its anti-establishment crime footage with scripted stories. At a UBS stockholders' meeting, Hackett announces plans to end the independent news division's autonomy because it loses money. Discovering that his authority has been undermined, Max is outraged, and believes that Hackett purposely humiliated him. On Wednesday evening, Howard broadcasts his final show. He apologizes to his audience for his threatened suicide, and explains that he had no other recourse. Howard repeats a vulgarity several times, but Max refuses the producer's request to take his friend off the air, even though sixty-seven million people are watching the incident on live television. UBS chairman Ed Ruddy asks for Max's resignation, Howard Beale becomes a media sensation, and his rant is headlined on the front page of New York City's biggest newspapers. Calling Howard a ""latter day prophet denouncing the hypocracies of our time,"" Diana tells Hackett she wants to put Howard back on the air, because his show rose five rating points in one night and will jump another fifteen points if he returns. She promises to make the news show a hit, and Hackett and Ruddy agree. Max is permitted to stay with UBS, and Howard's ratings go up for the next few days. When public interest begins to wane, Diana demands that Howard act more extreme. She also adds new elements to the program, including a psychic and a gossip columnist. To solidify her authority over the enterprise, Diana seduces Max. The following night, Howard tells his audience that a voice woke him up that morning and told him to report the truth. Sleeping at Max's apartment to avoid the press, Howard awakens the following morning, puts on his raincoat, and spends the day walking in the rain. When Max tells Hackett he wants to take Howard off the air because he is having an emotional breakdown, Hackett fires Max. Only minutes before Howard's show begins that evening, he walks into UBS from the rain, still dressed in his pajamas, and complains to his television audience about the ills of society. He tells them to get out of their chairs, stick their heads out their windows, and yell, ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore!"" Diana receives calls from UBS affiliates around the country, reporting that people are screaming out their windows. At Max's New York apartment, his daughter opens a window and watches hundreds of neighbors shouting Howard's new catchphrase. Billed as ""the mad prophet of the airwaves,"" Howard skyrockets in the ratings. Diana travels to Los Angeles to talk with Laureen Hobbs about setting up the ELA's ""political terrorism"" program, called The Mao Tse Tung Hour, even though the ELA is wanted by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation. Later, Howard tells his audience that UBS chairman Ed Ruddy has died and now the network's owner, a conglomerate called Communication Corporation of America (CCA), will control the news content. Since few Americans read or think for themselves, and television is their only ""truth,"" they must save themselves by turning off their television sets. After Ruddy's funeral, Max and Diana rekindle their relationship and vacation in New England for a weekend, while Max's wife, Louise Schumacher, is out of town. Diana talks incessantly about rating shares and television business, even during sex, but despite his disapproval of Diana's worldview, Max remains infatuated. When Max confesses the affair to his wife, she asks him to leave their apartment and he moves in with Diana. At the UBS affiliates convention in Los Angeles, Diana rouses the audience with the network's new ratings, while Hackett is called away from the banquet to answer a phone call from CCA CEO Arthur Jensen's office. Hackett is told to turn on a television set and watch Howard Beale inveighing against a consortium of banks that is buying CCA, and therefore UBS, for Saudi Arabian interests. Howard tells his audience to contact the White House and stop the deal. Informed that the East Coast broadcast alone has already flooded the U.S. President with telegrams, Hackett is ordered to return to New York City and have Howard Beale in Arthur Jensen's office at 10 a.m. When they arrive, Jensen takes Howard into a private boardroom, berates him for wrecking the Saudi deal, and explains that corporations, not nations, run the world. Jensen wants Howard to preach this new message to his audience. When Howard returns to the air, he stops complaining about corporate greed and national ills. His ratings plummet. Diana wants to replace Howard, but Jensen demands that he stay on the air regardless of ratings. Realizing that Diana represents the madness that has taken over modern media, Max leaves her, hoping his wife may take him back. Diana and Hackett save their ratings by hiring the ELA to assassinate Howard during his television show.",United States,,2809.0,1040

When Max tells Hackett he wants to take Howard off the air because he is having an emotional breakdown, Hackett fires Max. Only minutes before Howard's show begins that evening, he walks into UBS from the rain, still dressed in his pajamas, and complains to his television audience about the ills of society. He tells them to get out of their chairs, stick their heads out their windows, and yell, ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore!"" Diana receives calls from UBS affiliates around the country, reporting that people are screaming out their windows. At Max's New York apartment, his daughter opens a window and watches hundreds of neighbors shouting Howard's new catchphrase. Billed as ""the mad prophet of the airwaves,"" Howard skyrockets in the ratings. Diana travels to Los Angeles to talk with Laureen Hobbs about setting up the ELA's ""political terrorism"" program, called The Mao Tse Tung Hour, even though the ELA is wanted by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation. Later, Howard tells his audience that UBS chairman Ed Ruddy has died and now the network's owner, a conglomerate called Communication Corporation of America (CCA), will control the news content. Since few Americans read or think for themselves, and television is their only ""truth,"" they must save themselves by turning off their television sets. After Ruddy's funeral, Max and Diana rekindle their relationship and vacation in New England for a weekend, while Max's wife, Louise Schumacher, is out of town. Diana talks incessantly about rating shares and television business, even during sex, but despite his disapproval of Diana's worldview, Max remains infatuated. When Max confesses the affair to his wife, she asks him to leave their apartment and he moves in with Diana. At the UBS affiliates convention in Los Angeles, Diana rouses the audience with the network's new ratings, while Hackett is called away from the banquet to answer a phone call from CCA CEO Arthur Jensen's office. Hackett is told to turn on a television set and watch Howard Beale inveighing against a consortium of banks that is buying CCA, and therefore UBS, for Saudi Arabian interests. Howard tells his audience to contact the White House and stop the deal. Informed that the East Coast broadcast alone has already flooded the U.S. President with telegrams, Hackett is ordered to return to New York City and have Howard Beale in Arthur Jensen's office at 10 a.m. When they arrive, Jensen takes Howard into a private boardroom, berates him for wrecking the Saudi deal, and explains that corporations, not nations, run the world. Jensen wants Howard to preach this new message to his audience. When Howard returns to the air, he stops complaining about corporate greed and national ills. His ratings plummet. Diana wants to replace Howard, but Jensen demands that he stay on the air regardless of ratings. Realizing that Diana represents the madness that has taken over modern media, Max leaves her, hoping his wife may take him back. Diana and Hackett save their ratings by hiring the ELA to assassinate Howard during his television show.",United States,,2809.0,1040

His anklet is tosses into another vehicle. Peter's team storms into Neal's apartment looking for him. They find it empty, but Mozzie wanders in with a body double, clearly about to start planning something with Neal. Peter questions Mozzie at the station. Mozzie is adamant Neal hasn't left, in large part because he would have gone with Mozzie. They realize somebody must have taken him. We see Neal has been brought to an abandoned building and is cuffed to a chair. He's being held by Booth, Rebecca's former associate. He wants Neal to help him steal the diamond from the feds. Booth says he doesn't want to sell it. Booth's phone rings. As Mozzie walks out he sees Rebecca being brought in. Mozzie wants to help interrogate her but Peter isn't having it. Neal manages to get a screw out of the back of his chair, but he doesn't pick his cuffs. Neal overhears Booth on the phone. He references Woodruff, the head of the Pink Panthers. Booth wants to join the Panthers, but he needs to steal something impressive to get the invite. Since he's seen their faces, if he doesn't get into the group he'll be killed. Neal says he'll help him steal something else. Peter asks Rebecca to tell him who has Neal. He talks to her about the fact he chose Neal and ""what's right"" over going to DC with his wife. He says he knows she loves Neal and thinks she'll help him. Neal suggests the way to go is to try and steal from Woodford himself in order to impress the Panthers. Booth says Wooford's in town, working out of the Kessman Building. As a show of good faith so Booth knows he can trust Neal, he convinces him they should change locations as Peter will be there any minute. It works, as they leave just before the FBI arrives.

One of the passengers, Eastern attorney James Corwin, has been wounded in the raid, and when Hoppy discovers that Corwin's destination is Glenby, Texas, he sends Jimmy and California to Texas to investigate, while he escorts Nolan to jail and Corwin to the Bar 20 to recuperate. In Texas, California and Jimmy hire on as hands at Virginia Curtis' Lazy W ranch and discover that Virginia and the other ranchers are being terrorized by a gang of renegades known as the ""Night Riders."" Soon after, Hoppy arrives, attired as a dude and posing as Corwin, Virginia's cousin and half-owner of the Lazy W. When J. K. Trimble, the town attorney and covert leader of the renegades, approaches Hoppy about selling his share of the Lazy W, Virginia suspects that her cousin is planning to betray her. After Hoppy rejects Trimble's offer, Trimble orders his thugs to eliminate Hoppy and evict John Martindale, a rancher who owes him money. While escorting Hoppy to the Lazy W, California and Jimmy point out Satan's Garden, the alleged gathering place of the Night Riders. The next morning, Hoppy rides to Satan's Garden to investigate, and after he dismounts, his horse, startled by coyote calls simulated by the outlaws, runs away. When the renegades begin to shoot at Hoppy, he pulls out his gun and captures them. Drawn by the sound of gunshots, Virginia rides into Satan's Garden and informs Hoppy that the men he has apprehended are Jeff and Al, two of her ranch hands who have been ordered to shoot strangers on sight. Unknown to Virginia, Jeff and Al are actually in Trimble's employ. Upon returning to the ranch, Virginia quizzes Hoppy about family relations and tricks him into revealing that he is an impostor. When Hoppy hands her a note from Corwin, explaining that Hoppy is acting in his behalf, Virginia confides that she suspects that Trimble is in league with the renegades. Soon after, Sykes, one of Trimble's thugs, accompanies the deputy sheriff to Martindale's ranch to present the rancher with an eviction notice. While defending his property, Martindale struggles with Sykes, and pulls a gun and shoots him. After the deputy sheriff gallops off, Hoppy and his sidekicks, drawn by the sound of gunshots, ride to the Martindale ranch. When Martindale relates Trimble's eagerness to acquire the ranch and shows Hoppy a pool of black liquid, Hoppy realizes that Trimble wants the land for the oil lying beneath it. Meanwhile, the deputy sheriff rides into town and charges Martindale with Sykes's murder. Ace Maxson, the owner of the saloon who is secretly in league with Trimble, then incites a mob to ride to the Martindale ranch. At the ranch, Maxson places a noose around Martindale's neck, but Hoppy shoots down the rope, announces that he is Martindale's attorney and chases Maxson off the property. When Nolan, who has just escaped from jail, rides into town, Maxson hires him to replace Sykes. After recognizing Hoppy, Nolan gladly accepts the job and assembles the Riders for a raid against Hoppy at the Lazy W. That night, Hoppy sends Jimmy to meet Corwin at the junction and dispatches California to gather a posse to arrest Trimble and his men. When the Riders strike, Hoppy discovers that all the guns in the house have been emptied by Jeff and Al. After entrusting to Virginia papers deputizing him as a U.S. Marshal and the arrest warrants for Trimble and his men, Hoppy sends her to safety. When Nolan breaks down the door, Hoppy extracts a gun hidden in the desk, shoots him and holds off the others until California, Corwin and the posse ride to the rescue and disperse the gang.

Soon after, Sykes, one of Trimble's thugs, accompanies the deputy sheriff to Martindale's ranch to present the rancher with an eviction notice. While defending his property, Martindale struggles with Sykes, and pulls a gun and shoots him. After the deputy sheriff gallops off, Hoppy and his sidekicks, drawn by the sound of gunshots, ride to the Martindale ranch.

The king of Shilla, Kim Choon-Chu established diplomatic and military ties with the super-power Tang, or as we know it today, China. He ordered his general Kim Yu-Sin to meet with the general of Tang. Tang, the superpower, had the upper hand in the meetings and ordered Kim Yu-Sin to tell his king that the Kingdom of Shilla would have to pay a tribute to Tang no later than July 10th in order to shore up their newfound diplomatic relations. But geographically, in order to bring the tribute to Tang, Shilla had to cross the firmly defended kingdoms of Baekche and Koguryo. Fearing a new alliance between Tang and Shilla, Baekche and Koguryo disallowed Shilla to cross through their kingdoms. This act of defiance was a self-fulfilling prophecy as it angered Tang who sided with Shilla in a war. They decided to attack the weaker, more corrupt of the two other kingdoms, Baekche. As Tang's ships began arriving at the western coast of the Baekche kingdom, Baekche's king and his cabinet grew anxious, worrying that Tang's marines would stage a joint attack on their kingdom with Shilla. The king sent word to his lords to prepare their troops, but the call to arms was blocked by powerful lords who were hostile toward the king. As it turns out their deepest concerns were confirmed; they were being boxed in by Tang and Shilla and had little military support with which to defend the kingdom. The only person who remained loyal to the king of Baekche was Kye-Baek. He was summoned to the palace, where the king served him three glasses of wine, a symbolic gesture asking him to defend the kingdom. Kye-Baek agrees. Knowing that his army does not stand a chance against its aggressors, and that they will rape and pillage Baekche, he kills his own family then rushes off to defend his kingdom at Hwangsanbul, a plain between two naturally fortified mountains and the only way to the palace. Having only one-tenth the military power of its aggressors, it seemed that the battle would be over before it started. But surprisingly the small but tenacious Baekche army stood it's ground against 8 separate confrontations with Shilla. As time went by and the deadline for Shilla to bring the tribute to Tang came closer, Kim Yu-Sin, feeling greater and greater pressure, resorted to the cruel psychological strategy of putting the Hwarang, kids of the Shilla noble class in royal cadets, on the front lines to degrade the moral of the Baekche army.

Tang, the superpower, had the upper hand in the meetings and ordered Kim Yu-Sin to tell his king that the Kingdom of Shilla would have to pay a tribute to Tang no later than July 10th in order to shore up their newfound diplomatic relations. But geographically, in order to bring the tribute to Tang, Shilla had to cross the firmly defended kingdoms of Baekche and Koguryo. Fearing a new alliance between Tang and Shilla, Baekche and Koguryo disallowed Shilla to cross through their kingdoms. This act of defiance was a self-fulfilling prophecy as it angered Tang who sided with Shilla in a war. They decided to attack the weaker, more corrupt of the two other kingdoms, Baekche. As Tang's ships began arriving at the western coast of the Baekche kingdom, Baekche's king and his cabinet grew anxious, worrying that Tang's marines would stage a joint attack on their kingdom with Shilla. The king sent word to his lords to prepare their troops, but the call to arms was blocked by powerful lords who were hostile toward the king. As it turns out their deepest concerns were confirmed; they were being boxed in by Tang and Shilla and had little military support with which to defend the kingdom. The only person who remained loyal to the king of Baekche was Kye-Baek. He was summoned to the palace, where the king served him three glasses of wine, a symbolic gesture asking him to defend the kingdom. Kye-Baek agrees. Knowing that his army does not stand a chance against its aggressors, and that they will rape and pillage Baekche, he kills his own family then rushes off to defend his kingdom at Hwangsanbul, a plain between two naturally fortified mountains and the only way to the palace. Having only one-tenth the military power of its aggressors, it seemed that the battle would be over before it started. But surprisingly the small but tenacious Baekche army stood it's ground against 8 separate confrontations with Shilla. As time went by and the deadline for Shilla to bring the tribute to Tang came closer, Kim Yu-Sin, feeling greater and greater pressure, resorted to the cruel psychological strategy of putting the Hwarang, kids of the Shilla noble class in royal cadets, on the front lines to degrade the moral of the Baekche army. Who will be the victor of this most important historic war?",South Korea,,773.0,457

Stanley the owner is giving her a hard time when suddenly the man starts coughing up blood. They call 911, but he keels over dead. In the morning at Maura's house, Maura and Jane are exhausted from taking care of the baby. Tommy finally got him to stop crying by rocking him. Tommy wants to name him Mario. Maura swabs Tommy's mouth to get DNA for the paternity test. Jane holds the baby and admits she wishes she could keep him, you know, some of the time. They get a call about the suspicious death at the cafe and head in. At the cafe, Jane comforts her traumatized Mom. Stanley insists they didn't feed him anything bad. The victim is Phil Taylor, 45, he works at a pharmaceutical company. He had a picture of a young boy in his wallet and Korsak's name and number. When Maura asks for the plate of food he was eating, Stanley seems to get faint and light-headed. Angela doesn't know what happened to it. Frankie arrives at Maura's house, Tommy is freaked out because the baby rolled off the couch onto a pillow. There's a knock at the door, Lydia and her mom barge in. Frankie can't arrest her for abandoning him because technically all she did was leave him with family. They take him and leave. Down in the lab, Maura pokes through the victim's barely digested stomach contents of eggs and pancakes. She also finds chocolate and mint, which she thinks came from a frappaccino, which they don't serve at the cafe. His medical records indicate he had warfarin in his blood, a blood thinner also found in rat poison. Jane and a tech head down to the cafe to look for evidence of poisoning. They confiscate the rat poison and Jane interviews Stanley. Upstairs, they've found the photo in Phil's wallet was not of his son. He lost his pharm job five years ago and was doing temp work. Korsak's number was written on St. Avitas note paper, where they have an AA meeting every morning. Korsak and Frost head to the church. Frankie breaks the news about Lydia taking the baby to Jane. At the AA meeting, a lawyer named Larry is sharing while sort of advertising his services. A woman recognizes Korsak and plants a wet one on his lips. It takes him a while to place her, but he realizes it's his first wife, Dana. They were only married for three months 40 years ago. Dana says Phil was there that morning and she gave him Korsak's number because he needed a cop he could trust. Dana says he was hanging out with a blonde woman in her 40s. Back in Maura's office, Jane gets off the phone from an assistant district attorney who confirms they can't do much with Lydia. There's a three month wait for a custody hearing, during which TJ would be in foster care. They don't think Lydia will hurt him. Test confirm that the poison was delivered in the food. Jane asks Frankie to dig through the trash for the food and a disposable coffee cup. Maura flirts with Alex Simmons, the guy who brings the bodies. She thinks he's cute. He's in med school, but also sews, knits and crochets. He brought in Lucy Cox, 32, who was found dead in her apartment. She was sick for a week. Maura looks at her lung x-ray and sees bloody streaks on her fingernails. Then she tells Jane and Alex to hold their breath and head for the lab as she pushes the code red button. It could be anything from Ebola to SARS, Maura says later as tech come in Tyveks suits to clean the place out. They have to strip, take decontamination showers and get in the suits. Jane suddenly feels very modest and does a complicated dance hiding behind a trash can to avoid showing her bits. Maura checks with the CDC, there's no report of any hemorrhagic viruses in the area, but there is a report of treatable bacterial meningitis in Boston. Maura is awaiting the victim's test results. Alex's girlfriend, Suzy the lab tech, comes to check on him. Maura gets the results, it is meningitis, which is good news. Frankie reports he couldn't find Phil's food. Back upstairs, Angela comes with Phil's thrown out drink cup which she found in the lobby trash can. Phil had told her Stanley made him throw it out. Korsak get a text from Dana, she wants to talk about Phil's murder. Dana tells Korsak that Phil said he ruined a little boy's life. He said he had blood on his hands and made another terrible mistake. Dana tells Korsak she feels terrible she didn't wait for him to come back from Vietnam. In the lab, Suzy reports there was warfarin in the coffee cup. She mentions she and Alex met at a nudist retreat. There are 50 Boston Joe's where Phil could have bought the coffee. Upstairs, they try to figure out what Phil felt guilty about. They find a hit and run from five years ago, eight-year-old Jimmy Flores was paralyzed. Phil said his car was stolen at the time. Jane decides to go to the Boston Joe's by St. Avitas. The barista recognizes his photo. He was with a tall, skinny dour woman, who the barista remembers took Phil's coffee and dumped a lot of sugar in it. They assume it wasn't sugar. Later, at Jane's house, Tommy says the paternity test confirms TJ is his. Frankie, Angela and Jane are excited to have the baby in their lives. They suggests fighting for joint custody, but Angela has another idea. The next morning, Jane stops by the cafe. Stanley tells her he wants to confess. Upstairs, he admits he hid Phil's food. He has it in a Ziploc bag. They give him a hard time, but tell him they can't charge him with anything. Upstairs, they look at surveillance from the Boston Joe's which shows Phil and the mystery woman. There's no sound, so Jane calls Frankie in to read their lips, which he learned how to do playing baseball. He thinks Phil is saying: ""I didn't sign up for this, I didn't know men in tights would kill people."" Or maybe ""Mennonites."" Facial recognition IDs the woman as Alice Vanderbilt. They head to her house and find her in her garage with her engine running. She's dead. Later, in the morgue, Maura confirms she died of carbon monoxide poisoning. Her prints were the only ones found on everything, so they're calling it suicide. Alex brings in the body of Brian Radcliff, 31. Alex thinks it might be meningitis. Jane realizes that's what Phil was saying, not ""men in tights."" Back upstairs, they find Alice was a quality control tech at Phil's company. She was previously an anesthesiologist. Maura reports there was an injection site on Brian's arm from a flu vaccine. Both victims only died from the meningitis because they had underlying conditions. They think Phil and Alice conspired to taint the vaccine so they could launch a class action lawsuit against the pharma company. But they'd need a lawyer. They find a name on Alice's lapsed medical license: Larry Bukowski. Jane, Frost and Korsak interrupt the AA meeting and serve Larry with a warrant to check his car. He has a ton of flyers trolling for people who got meningitis from a flu vaccine. He also has a picture of Phil with his bloody car from the night he ran over Jimmy Florres. He still has Phil's license plate. He handled malpractice cases for Alice. They find the lot number for the bad vaccine and arrest Larry. Lydia and her difficult mother come over for dinner at Maura's house. Angela says it's a chance for them all to start over. Lydia's mom starts off on the right foot by asking for water and a prescription for Antabuse from Maura. Lydia lets Angela hold him and they all sit down to dinner as a family.",United States,,55.0,1354

Stanley the owner is giving her a hard time when suddenly the man starts coughing up blood. They call 911, but he keels over dead. In the morning at Maura's house, Maura and Jane are exhausted from taking care of the baby. Tommy finally got him to stop crying by rocking him. Tommy wants to name him Mario. Maura swabs Tommy's mouth to get DNA for the paternity test. Jane holds the baby and admits she wishes she could keep him, you know, some of the time. They get a call about the suspicious death at the cafe and head in. At the cafe, Jane comforts her traumatized Mom. Stanley insists they didn't feed him anything bad. The victim is Phil Taylor, 45, he works at a pharmaceutical company. He had a picture of a young boy in his wallet and Korsak's name and number. When Maura asks for the plate of food he was eating, Stanley seems to get faint and light-headed. Angela doesn't know what happened to it. Frankie arrives at Maura's house, Tommy is freaked out because the baby rolled off the couch onto a pillow. There's a knock at the door, Lydia and her mom barge in. Frankie can't arrest her for abandoning him because technically all she did was leave him with family. They take him and leave. Down in the lab, Maura pokes through the victim's barely digested stomach contents of eggs and pancakes. She also finds chocolate and mint, which she thinks came from a frappaccino, which they don't serve at the cafe. His medical records indicate he had warfarin in his blood, a blood thinner also found in rat poison. Jane and a tech head down to the cafe to look for evidence of poisoning. They confiscate the rat poison and Jane interviews Stanley. Upstairs, they've found the photo in Phil's wallet was not of his son. He lost his pharm job five years ago and was doing temp work. Korsak's number was written on St. Avitas note paper, where they have an AA meeting every morning. Korsak and Frost head to the church. Frankie breaks the news about Lydia taking the baby to Jane. At the AA meeting, a lawyer named Larry is sharing while sort of advertising his services. A woman recognizes Korsak and plants a wet one on his lips. It takes him a while to place her, but he realizes it's his first wife, Dana. They were only married for three months 40 years ago. Dana says Phil was there that morning and she gave him Korsak's number because he needed a cop he could trust. Dana says he was hanging out with a blonde woman in her 40s. Back in Maura's office, Jane gets off the phone from an assistant district attorney who confirms they can't do much with Lydia. There's a three month wait for a custody hearing, during which TJ would be in foster care. They don't think Lydia will hurt him. Test confirm that the poison was delivered in the food. Jane asks Frankie to dig through the trash for the food and a disposable coffee cup. Maura flirts with Alex Simmons, the guy who brings the bodies. She thinks he's cute. He's in med school, but also sews, knits and crochets. He brought in Lucy Cox, 32, who was found dead in her apartment. She was sick for a week. Maura looks at her lung x-ray and sees bloody streaks on her fingernails. Then she tells Jane and Alex to hold their breath and head for the lab as she pushes the code red button. It could be anything from Ebola to SARS, Maura says later as tech come in Tyveks suits to clean the place out. They have to strip, take decontamination showers and get in the suits. Jane suddenly feels very modest and does a complicated dance hiding behind a trash can to avoid showing her bits. Maura checks with the CDC, there's no report of any hemorrhagic viruses in the area, but there is a report of treatable bacterial meningitis in Boston. Maura is awaiting the victim's test results. Alex's girlfriend, Suzy the lab tech, comes to check on him. Maura gets the results, it is meningitis, which is good news. Frankie reports he couldn't find Phil's food. Back upstairs, Angela comes with Phil's thrown out drink cup which she found in the lobby trash can. Phil had told her Stanley made him throw it out. Korsak get a text from Dana, she wants to talk about Phil's murder. Dana tells Korsak that Phil said he ruined a little boy's life. He said he had blood on his hands and made another terrible mistake. Dana tells Korsak she feels terrible she didn't wait for him to come back from Vietnam. In the lab, Suzy reports there was warfarin in the coffee cup. She mentions she and Alex met at a nudist retreat. There are 50 Boston Joe's where Phil could have bought the coffee. Upstairs, they try to figure out what Phil felt guilty about. They find a hit and run from five years ago, eight-year-old Jimmy Flores was paralyzed. Phil said his car was stolen at the time. Jane decides to go to the Boston Joe's by St. Avitas. The barista recognizes his photo. He was with a tall, skinny dour woman, who the barista remembers took Phil's coffee and dumped a lot of sugar in it. They assume it wasn't sugar. Later, at Jane's house, Tommy says the paternity test confirms TJ is his. Frankie, Angela and Jane are excited to have the baby in their lives. They suggests fighting for joint custody, but Angela has another idea. The next morning, Jane stops by the cafe. Stanley tells her he wants to confess. Upstairs, he admits he hid Phil's food. He has it in a Ziploc bag. They give him a hard time, but tell him they can't charge him with anything. Upstairs, they look at surveillance from the Boston Joe's which shows Phil and the mystery woman. There's no sound, so Jane calls Frankie in to read their lips, which he learned how to do playing baseball. He thinks Phil is saying: ""I didn't sign up for this, I didn't know men in tights would kill people."" Or maybe ""Mennonites."" Facial recognition IDs the woman as Alice Vanderbilt. They head to her house and find her in her garage with her engine running. She's dead. Later, in the morgue, Maura confirms she died of carbon monoxide poisoning. Her prints were the only ones found on everything, so they're calling it suicide. Alex brings in the body of Brian Radcliff, 31. Alex thinks it might be meningitis. Jane realizes that's what Phil was saying, not ""men in tights."" Back upstairs, they find Alice was a quality control tech at Phil's company. She was previously an anesthesiologist. Maura reports there was an injection site on Brian's arm from a flu vaccine. Both victims only died from the meningitis because they had underlying conditions. They think Phil and Alice conspired to taint the vaccine so they could launch a class action lawsuit against the pharma company. But they'd need a lawyer. They find a name on Alice's lapsed medical license: Larry Bukowski. Jane, Frost and Korsak interrupt the AA meeting and serve Larry with a warrant to check his car. He has a ton of flyers trolling for people who got meningitis from a flu vaccine. He also has a picture of Phil with his bloody car from the night he ran over Jimmy Florres. He still has Phil's license plate. He handled malpractice cases for Alice. They find the lot number for the bad vaccine and arrest Larry. Lydia and her difficult mother come over for dinner at Maura's house. Angela says it's a chance for them all to start over. Lydia's mom starts off on the right foot by asking for water and a prescription for Antabuse from Maura.

Sometime later, Jake's daughter, Kristen, boards a bus for Bellflower, California, to attend the Youth Calvinist Convention, and, after seeing her off, Jake supervises work at his furniture factory. That Sunday, following church services, Jake receives a phone call, alerting him to Kristen's disappearance during a field trip to Knott's Berry Farm, and he flies to California with his brother-in-law, Wes DeJong. There, Wes's daughter, Marsha, explains that Kristen was last seen with an older boy that she met at the park, and Detective Burrows suggests that Jake seek help outside of the police force. Jake and Wes meet private detective Andy Mast, who promises to find Kristen for a fee of $750 a week and asks Jake to go back to Grand Rapids to look for clues. At home, Jake is troubled by Kristen's disappearance and Wes encourages him to hold faith. Jake soon receives a call from Mast, who has arrived in Grand Rapids. When Mast takes Jake to a pornographic movie theater to show him a hardcore film which features Kristen, Slave of Love, Jake cries and screams for Mast to turn off the projector. Mast explains the transient nature of the pornographic film industry and says he does not yet know Kristen's whereabouts. Back in Los Angeles, Mast goes to the motel room set of a hardcore film to question his former colleague, Bill Ramada, but the man claims ignorance about Kristen. Four months later, Jake returns to California to search for Kristen, himself. Paying a surprise visit to Masts's apartment, Jake discovers the detective seducing a porn star named Terry. After firing Mast and kicking him out of his own residence, Jake finds film stills from Slave of Love and begins an investigation of Los Angeles's red light district. Outraged that no one will identify Kristen from the photographs, Jake decides to pose as a pornographic film producer, using the alias ""Jake Devries,"" and meets with Ramada and his partner, Kurt. Ramada turns down Jake's offer to invest $50,000 but promises to introduce him to less established filmmakers who might be interested. Later, Jake posts a classified advertisement in a local newspaper for pornographic actors, hoping to meet Kristen's co-star in Slave of Love . On the set of one of Ramada's films, Jake meets a porn star named Niki. Back at his motel room, Jake is confronted by Wes, who has come from Grand Rapids with concern for his brother-in-law, but Jake asks him to leave. The next day, Jake holds casting calls for his mock film, and after a series of unsuccessful interviews, he meets Jim Sloane, a.k.a. Jism Jim, whom he identifies as the actor in the Slave of Love film stills. However, when Jake shows Jim a photograph and expresses interest in hiring Kristen, Jim argues that he will never work with her again because she injured him during sex and exhibited strange behaviors. Hitting Jim over the head with a lamp and dragging him into the shower, Jake forces the young man to report that Kristen worked with a man named Tod, who lives in San Diego. Although Jim knows nothing more about Kristen, he refers Jake to Niki, claiming that she is in contact with Tod. At a peep show parlor, Jake reunites with Niki and agrees to pay her $900 a week for her assistance. Meanwhile, Wes finds Mast at a restaurant and hires him to protect Jake. At a motel, Jake explains to Niki that Kristen is his daughter and his wife is deceased. The next day, as they wait at the airport for a flight to San Diego, Niki describes herself as a Venusian, a believer in Venus, the goddess of love, and claims that Jake's Calvinism is negative and punitive. In San Diego, Niki tracks down a former client named Jim Rucker. She learns that Tod has been working with Ratan, a dangerous, sadomasochistic filmmaker, in Tijuana, Mexico, but is now residing in San Francisco. After Niki and Jake relocate to San Francisco, Niki sets up a meeting between Jake and Tod. As she and Jake wait at their motel, Niki accurately surmises that Jake's wife is not really dead and suggests that Kristen became troubled when her mother left the family for a new life. Admitting that she is at the mercy of her pimp, Niki concludes that both she and Jake are victims of misfortune. Just then, Mast knocks on the motel room door and reports that the police are concerned about Jake's safety. When Jake inquires about Ratan, Mast says the man is a threat and offers to work on the case. Later, at a meeting with Tod, Jake asks to meet Ratan. Although Tod feigns ignorance of Ratan, he agrees to let Jake view a sadomasochistic film they recently shot together in Mexico, featuring Kristen, in which Ratan murders two people. Returning to his motel room, Jake finds Mast quarreling with Niki, and when the detective leaves, Jake demands that Niki reveal Tod's whereabouts. She refuses, concerned that Jake will abandon her once he finds his daughter, but when Jake hits her, she admits that Tod works at a bondage house in North Beach. Kissing Niki's forehead, Jake promises not to forget her. As Jake leaves, Mast tries to stop him and calls the police. At the sadomasochistic club, Jake finds Tod and demands to know the location of Kristen and Ratan. As Tod smashes through the thin walls of the club's dungeons, Jake gives chase and accosts him outside. Threatened by Jake's aggression, Tod confesses that Ratan is at a nearby bar called El Matador. There, Jake confronts Ratan and Kristen, but Ratan pursues him with a knife. As Ratan runs from the bar, Mast arrives and shoots him in the back, killing him. Meanwhile, Kristen hides in the bar's cellar and begs her father not to hurt her. Although Jake thinks Kristen was forced into pornography, she admits to willfully leaving her father and accuses Jake of disregarding her needs. When Kristen claims her new friends care more for her than Jake, her father tearfully confesses his inability to show love and promises to change. Despite Kristen's demand that Jake leave, she decides to return to her father's care. After Jake guides Kristen into a police car, he sees Niki in the crowd and offers to help her, but she walks away. When Jake asks Mast to look after Niki, the detective tells him to go home. Mast claims there is nothing Jake can do to rescue Niki because he does not belong in her world. Nodding in agreement, Jake joins his daughter in the police car.",United States,,2441.0,1130

Sometime later, Jake's daughter, Kristen, boards a bus for Bellflower, California, to attend the Youth Calvinist Convention, and, after seeing her off, Jake supervises work at his furniture factory. That Sunday, following church services, Jake receives a phone call, alerting him to Kristen's disappearance during a field trip to Knott's Berry Farm, and he flies to California with his brother-in-law, Wes DeJong. There, Wes's daughter, Marsha, explains that Kristen was last seen with an older boy that she met at the park, and Detective Burrows suggests that Jake seek help outside of the police force. Jake and Wes meet private detective Andy Mast, who promises to find Kristen for a fee of $750 a week and asks Jake to go back to Grand Rapids to look for clues. At home, Jake is troubled by Kristen's disappearance and Wes encourages him to hold faith. Jake soon receives a call from Mast, who has arrived in Grand Rapids. When Mast takes Jake to a pornographic movie theater to show him a hardcore film which features Kristen, Slave of Love, Jake cries and screams for Mast to turn off the projector. Mast explains the transient nature of the pornographic film industry and says he does not yet know Kristen's whereabouts. Back in Los Angeles, Mast goes to the motel room set of a hardcore film to question his former colleague, Bill Ramada, but the man claims ignorance about Kristen. Four months later, Jake returns to California to search for Kristen, himself. Paying a surprise visit to Masts's apartment, Jake discovers the detective seducing a porn star named Terry. After firing Mast and kicking him out of his own residence, Jake finds film stills from Slave of Love and begins an investigation of Los Angeles's red light district. Outraged that no one will identify Kristen from the photographs, Jake decides to pose as a pornographic film producer, using the alias ""Jake Devries,"" and meets with Ramada and his partner, Kurt. Ramada turns down Jake's offer to invest $50,000 but promises to introduce him to less established filmmakers who might be interested. Later, Jake posts a classified advertisement in a local newspaper for pornographic actors, hoping to meet Kristen's co-star in Slave of Love . On the set of one of Ramada's films, Jake meets a porn star named Niki. Back at his motel room, Jake is confronted by Wes, who has come from Grand Rapids with concern for his brother-in-law, but Jake asks him to leave. The next day, Jake holds casting calls for his mock film, and after a series of unsuccessful interviews, he meets Jim Sloane, a.k.a. Jism Jim, whom he identifies as the actor in the Slave of Love film stills. However, when Jake shows Jim a photograph and expresses interest in hiring Kristen, Jim argues that he will never work with her again because she injured him during sex and exhibited strange behaviors. Hitting Jim over the head with a lamp and dragging him into the shower, Jake forces the young man to report that Kristen worked with a man named Tod, who lives in San Diego. Although Jim knows nothing more about Kristen, he refers Jake to Niki, claiming that she is in contact with Tod. At a peep show parlor, Jake reunites with Niki and agrees to pay her $900 a week for her assistance. Meanwhile, Wes finds Mast at a restaurant and hires him to protect Jake. At a motel, Jake explains to Niki that Kristen is his daughter and his wife is deceased. The next day, as they wait at the airport for a flight to San Diego, Niki describes herself as a Venusian, a believer in Venus, the goddess of love, and claims that Jake's Calvinism is negative and punitive. In San Diego, Niki tracks down a former client named Jim Rucker. She learns that Tod has been working with Ratan, a dangerous, sadomasochistic filmmaker, in Tijuana, Mexico, but is now residing in San Francisco. After Niki and Jake relocate to San Francisco, Niki sets up a meeting between Jake and Tod. As she and Jake wait at their motel, Niki accurately surmises that Jake's wife is not really dead and suggests that Kristen became troubled when her mother left the family for a new life. Admitting that she is at the mercy of her pimp, Niki concludes that both she and Jake are victims of misfortune. Just then, Mast knocks on the motel room door and reports that the police are concerned about Jake's safety. When Jake inquires about Ratan, Mast says the man is a threat and offers to work on the case. Later, at a meeting with Tod, Jake asks to meet Ratan. Although Tod feigns ignorance of Ratan, he agrees to let Jake view a sadomasochistic film they recently shot together in Mexico, featuring Kristen, in which Ratan murders two people. Returning to his motel room, Jake finds Mast quarreling with Niki, and when the detective leaves, Jake demands that Niki reveal Tod's whereabouts. She refuses, concerned that Jake will abandon her once he finds his daughter, but when Jake hits her, she admits that Tod works at a bondage house in North Beach. Kissing Niki's forehead, Jake promises not to forget her. As Jake leaves, Mast tries to stop him and calls the police. At the sadomasochistic club, Jake finds Tod and demands to know the location of Kristen and Ratan. As Tod smashes through the thin walls of the club's dungeons, Jake gives chase and accosts him outside. Threatened by Jake's aggression, Tod confesses that Ratan is at a nearby bar called El Matador. There, Jake confronts Ratan and Kristen, but Ratan pursues him with a knife. As Ratan runs from the bar, Mast arrives and shoots him in the back, killing him. Meanwhile, Kristen hides in the bar's cellar and begs her father not to hurt her. Although Jake thinks Kristen was forced into pornography, she admits to willfully leaving her father and accuses Jake of disregarding her needs. When Kristen claims her new friends care more for her than Jake, her father tearfully confesses his inability to show love and promises to change. Despite Kristen's demand that Jake leave, she decides to return to her father's care. After Jake guides Kristen into a police car, he sees Niki in the crowd and offers to help her, but she walks away. When Jake asks Mast to look after Niki, the detective tells him to go home. Mast claims there is nothing Jake can do to rescue Niki because he does not belong in her world. Nodding in agreement, Jake joins his daughter in the police car.",United States,,2441.0,1130

The top US diplomat, who appeared visibly shaken while speaking to the press, described seeing new graphic images and videos of the attacks, calling it “striking” and “shocking” that the brutality of the attack “has receded so quickly in the memories of so many.” “Today, we saw additional images, additional footage collected by the Israeli government from video cameras, some the terrorists, some others and communities that were attacked,” Blinken said after viewing graphic footage,previously shown to journalists. “It remains almost beyond the human capacity to process, to digest. On his fourthtrip to the countrysince the October attack, Blinken met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Isaac Herzog, and the country’s war cabinet. While he defended Israel’s right to respond to Hamas’ brutal attack, he delivered a message that suggests the Biden administration’s support for Israel’s approach is not limitless. In his meetings, Blinkendiscussed the need for continued humanitarian aid to reach Gaza and efforts to get hostages freed from Hamas. “We believe that each of these efforts would be facilitated by humanitarian pauses,” Blinken said. However, Netanyahu publicly rejected the idea of a pause in fighting without the release of hostages first. Speaking alongside Herzog earlier on Friday, Blinken reiterated that the way Israel conducts its operations matters. Herzog sought to emphasize that Israel is following international humanitarian law. He showed Blinken a leaflet – 1.2 million of which he said had been sent to citizens of Gaza warning them to leave before military operations – and said Israel had “carried out six million text messages and four million phone calls to the citizens of Gaza according to the rules of international law, where we alerted the citizens in advance.” As protesters could be heard outside the meeting demanding the release of hostages, the top US diplomat said they “are determined to do everything we can to bring them back safely, to bring them back to be with their families and loved ones.” “Our heart goes out to them. We understand it. We want their immediate release,” Herzog said. Blinken said ahead of his departure Thursday, for the next stop of his trip in Jordan, that he planned to discuss “steps that need to be taken to protect civilians” but declined to provide details on those steps. Privately, officials across the US government have warned their Israeli counterparts about the impact images of the devastation in Gaza – and the importance of allowing humanitarian aid in – on their ability to pursue their strategic aims as international condemnation grows wider and louder. And in his public remarks Friday, Blinken reiterated that the US has “been clear that as Israel conducts its campaign to defeat Hamas, how it does so matters – it matters because it’s the right and lawful thing to do. It matters because failure to do so plays into the hands of Hamas and other terror groups.” “There will be no partners for peace if they’re consumed by humanitarian catastrophe, and alienated by any perceived indifference to their plight,” he said.

Spanish police have arrested three people as part of an anti-terror investigation linked to the shooting of a far-right politician earlier this month. Police on Tuesday arrested two Spanish men and one British woman in connection with the shooting of Alejandro Vidal-Quadras, a co-founder of Spain’s Vox party. The attack is being investigated as “possible terrorism”, with Iranian opposition groups pointing the finger at Tehran. Vidal-Quadras was shot in the face in a Madrid street on November 9. The 78-year-old former political leader survived the attack and is recovering in a hospital with a double jaw fracture. Two suspects were arrested in the southern city of Lanjaron and the third in Fuengirola, the national police’s press department said. None of the arrested individuals is suspected of firing the shot that struck Vidal-Quadras, Spain’s state news agency reported. Vidal-Quadras, a longtime supporter of Iran’s political opposition in exile, has raised the possibility with police that he was targeted because of these ties, a police source said earlier this month. The Paris-based Iranian opposition group Committee of the National Council of Resistance of Iran described Vidal-Quadras as a staunch ally and blamed the Iranian government for the shooting. Police are investigating whether the arrested suspects have links with foreign countries but have not confirmed such a theory. In January, Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs imposed sanctions on Vidal-Quadras and others with ties to the exiled Iranian opposition group Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, accusing them of “supporting terrorism and terrorist groups”. The Iranian sanctions included a visa and entry ban and seizure of any property in Iran. Vidal-Quadras was shot on a sidewalk in the wealthy neighbourhood of Salamanca in central Madrid by a man who was wearing a helmet and rode pillion on a motorcycle. The hospital where he was admitted said on Tuesday he was making “good progress”. Vidal-Quadras was a key figure in Spain’s conservative Popular Party and a European Parliament member before he helped found Vox. He has not been active in politics for several years but maintained a public role as a media commentator and columnist.          Follow News Agency English:",,Al Jazeera English,45632.0,366

Spanish police have arrested three people as part of an anti-terror investigation linked to the shooting of a far-right politician earlier this month. Police on Tuesday arrested two Spanish men and one British woman in connection with the shooting of Alejandro Vidal-Quadras, a co-founder of Spain’s Vox party. The attack is being investigated as “possible terrorism”, with Iranian opposition groups pointing the finger at Tehran. Vidal-Quadras was shot in the face in a Madrid street on November 9. The 78-year-old former political leader survived the attack and is recovering in a hospital with a double jaw fracture. Two suspects were arrested in the southern city of Lanjaron and the third in Fuengirola, the national police’s press department said. None of the arrested individuals is suspected of firing the shot that struck Vidal-Quadras, Spain’s state news agency reported. Vidal-Quadras, a longtime supporter of Iran’s political opposition in exile, has raised the possibility with police that he was targeted because of these ties, a police source said earlier this month. The Paris-based Iranian opposition group Committee of the National Council of Resistance of Iran described Vidal-Quadras as a staunch ally and blamed the Iranian government for the shooting. Police are investigating whether the arrested suspects have links with foreign countries but have not confirmed such a theory. In January, Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs imposed sanctions on Vidal-Quadras and others with ties to the exiled Iranian opposition group Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, accusing them of “supporting terrorism and terrorist groups”. The Iranian sanctions included a visa and entry ban and seizure of any property in Iran. Vidal-Quadras was shot on a sidewalk in the wealthy neighbourhood of Salamanca in central Madrid by a man who was wearing a helmet and rode pillion on a motorcycle. The hospital where he was admitted said on Tuesday he was making “good progress”. Vidal-Quadras was a key figure in Spain’s conservative Popular Party and a European Parliament member before he helped found Vox. He has not been active in politics for several years but maintained a public role as a media commentator and columnist.          Follow News Agency English:",,Al Jazeera English,45632.0,366

After weeks of discussions on a “humanitarian pause”, there is finally a tenuous truce in place. This has been a long road, largely because Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants a never-ending war — in part to defer his ongoing domestic political and legal woes, and in part because he claims to want to pursue the almost impossible task of eliminating Hamas. Meanwhile, Hamas know their only hope for being perceived as victorious — however pyrrhic any such “win” might be — is to secure an indefinite ceasefire. With that scenario unlikely, they must also maintain a narrative of escalation, and use rhetoric to ensure that their regional allies remain primed and ready. Cue the rise of anti-diplomacy, which international security studies scholar James Der Deriancharacterisesas a form of “war by other means”. It encompasses practices that effectively perpetrate a form of violence against the traditional process of diplomatic mediation and reconciliation. Part of this anti-diplomacy is an increase in attacks on those advocating mediation, reconciliation and peace – often involving disinformation and propaganda. These attacks are multifaceted, occurring domestically, regionally and internationally. On November 23, the Israel account on X, run by the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs,posted anedited video showing an Israeli soldier purportedly navigating a Hamas tunnel near al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza — adding to a growing set of such videos. Intriguingly, the video references Qatar three times, specifically pointing out the tunnel’s proximity to the “Qatari compound” and the “Qatari building”. The phrase “Qatari building” in the context of al-Shifa has only ever been used since November 16, with the earliest mention appearing to emanate from a videopostedby the Israeli army. Usually, the Qatari building refers to the “Qatar Reconstruction HQ”, which lies 3km (1.9 miles) away. The use of such language is no coincidence. With propaganda, nothing happens by accident. Word choices — especially the mention of particular countries or people, are carefully selected to convey certain messages. In this case, it’s part of a broader attempt to try and link Qatar to Hamas and the Israeli narrative of al-Shifa serving as a command-and-control centre for the armed Palestinian group. Why? Qatarhas been playing a leading role in mediating for peace amid the current war. Its work has been central to the negotiations that have led to the release of captives by Hamas and Palestinian prisoners by Israel, starting Friday. By trying to undermine the mediator’s credibility, Israel hopes it can pressure Qatar into securing a better deal for itself — sometimes, even when its efforts are at odds with what the United States, its closest ally, is saying and doing. In October, for instance, the Israeli armydeleteda video critical of Qatar following US President Joe Biden’s commendation of Qatar for its mediation efforts, pointing to a tension between US policy and Israel’s internal politics. In other words, Israel’s attempts at anti-diplomacy have run afoul of the US, which has emphasised its faith in Qatar’s role as a mediator. There are other examples, too, of anti-diplomacy at work. United Nations Special Rapporteur for the Occupied Palestinian Territories Francesca Albanese has beenthe targetof a smear campaign accusing her of violating the UN’s Code of Conduct. Albanese, an international law expert and outspoken advocate of peace, publiclyrefutedaccusations promoted by pro-Israel propagandists surrounding a trip to Australia, clarifying that the journey was officially funded by the UN as part of its mandate. Albanese has emerged as one of the most eloquent and credible voices in calling for an end to the war through a ceasefire. Her snappy put-downs of ill-informed questions from journalists have frequentlygone viral, earning her a growing social media following. In Australia, one pro-peace protestereven held upa placard bearing her picture and the slogan “The real Albanese” — in a reference to the country’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. For Israel, the end of conflict may also mean the process of accountability beginning. This is why influential diplomatic voices like Albanese’s, calling for peace, are targets of disinformation. With more than 100,000 followers on X, her reach and social media savvy make her a threat to Israel’s forces of anti-diplomacy. The war on attempts to bridge differences — diplomacy, in a broader sense — is playing out on college campuses in the US and Europe, which have become battlegrounds of public opinion. There have been allegations of college protests promoting anti-Semitism and anti-Palestinianism. Yet these are also subject to anti-diplomacy campaigns designed to promote division and conflict. The University of British Columbia’s branch of Hillel, an organisation dedicated to promoting Jewish life on campus,reportedthat a contractor of theirs, without the organisation’s knowledge, had placed stickers around the campus with the message “I love Hamas”. The aim was clearly to manipulate anxieties and smear pro-Palestinian activists as necessarily pro-Hamas. Hamas will have its own propaganda plans for this period of truce. And in the absence of a full ceasefire — with Israel making it clear that it intends to continue the war after the pause — Hamas might have reasons to worry. At the moment, the global public mood, including in the West, seems to be in support of a ceasefire – although Western politicians seem less inclined to back that sentiment. Mainstream media and social media are vital in shaping opinions. Hamas knows this, and that it needs relentless global pressure against the war. Hamas doesn’t just need Gaza to remain in the news, but needs Palestinians to be humanised. Will the world stop caring as much if the temporary let-up in bombing slows down the tide of horrific social media videos of slaughtered civilians coming out of Gaza? With Israel gunning for further war, Hamas must prepare both militarily and also rhetorically. Enter anti-diplomacy, again. On November 23, after the truce had been announced and less than a day before it was to come into force, the military wing of Hamas releaseda videocalling for “all resistance fronts” to escalate confrontation with Israel. It may seem counterintuitive to call for an escalation right before a pause obtained through tough negotiations. But Hamas will not want the truce to send the signal to its allies in Yemen, Lebanon, Iraq and Iran that they can ease up in their support for the Palestinian group in the war against Israel. The threat of regional escalation — yes, on “all resistance fronts” — has been one of Hamas’s trump cards in trying to encourage even reluctant US efforts to call for a truce. So, what do I expect in the next few days? Israel will seek to keep public opinion mobilised in support of war and undermine mediators or those calling for peace. For their part, Hamas will want to generate maximum sympathy for Palestinian suffering, while also maintaining a level of bellicosity to maintain support from their allies. On November 25, the deal that has enabled a pause in fighting faced another crisis when Hamasdelayed the release of captives, accusing Israel of reneging on aspects of the agreement. It’s hard to say which side was to blame, or whether both shared responsibility — but the drama underscored the fragility of the truce. The bombing may have been paused, but war by other means continues. The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect News Agency’s editorial stance.

There were no casualties aboard the P-8A Poseidon aircraft, a twin-engine multimission patrol and reconnaissance jet with the airframe of a Boeing 737 passenger plane, according to Marine Corps spokesperson 1st Lt. Hailey Harms. Harms said the conditions of the nine personnel aboard were being assessed. Pictures showed the aircraft upright with its wings slightly above the waterline in Kaneohe Bay off Marine Corps Base Hawaii on the main island of Oahu, north of the capital of Honolulu. Visibility was down to around a mile at the time of the incident, with wind gusts up to 21 miles per hour and mist, according to the National Weather Service. The P-8A Poseidon is a workhorse of US Navy operations. It can carry both torpedoes and cruise missiles, while conducting antisubmarine and antisurface warfare and intelligence gathering missions. A statement from the US Navy’s Third Fleet said the jet, based in Whidbey Island, Washington, was “on a detachment in support of maritime homeland defense.” Earlier this year, a P-8A operating over the South China Sea with a News Agency crew aboard wasintercepted by a Chinese fighter jetin an encounter that saw the Chinese plane come within 500 feet of it.

Pictures showed the aircraft upright with its wings slightly above the waterline in Kaneohe Bay off Marine Corps Base Hawaii on the main island of Oahu, north of the capital of Honolulu. Visibility was down to around a mile at the time of the incident, with wind gusts up to 21 miles per hour and mist, according to the National Weather Service. The P-8A Poseidon is a workhorse of US Navy operations. It can carry both torpedoes and cruise missiles, while conducting antisubmarine and antisurface warfare and intelligence gathering missions. A statement from the US Navy’s Third Fleet said the jet, based in Whidbey Island, Washington, was “on a detachment in support of maritime homeland defense.” Earlier this year, a P-8A operating over the South China Sea with a News Agency crew aboard wasintercepted by a Chinese fighter jetin an encounter that saw the Chinese plane come within 500 feet of it.

They will not succeed in doing so,” spokesperson Mao Ning said. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby sidestepped a question about the Chinese response later on Thursday and focused on other parts of a reporter’s question. He said the president was “feeling very good about the content of the discussions” he had over the course of the four hours he met with the Chinese president on Wednesday. Beijingresponded furiouslyover the summer when the president made a similar comment and compared his Chinese counterpart to “dictators” in June. The president made that comment duringan off-camera campaign reception in California, hitting Xi for being caught by surprise after the US had shot down a Chinese spy balloon that had veered off course over the United States. “The reason why Xi Jinping got very upset in terms of when I shot that balloon down with two boxcars full of spy equipment in it is he didn’t know it was there. “No, I’m serious. That’s what’s a great embarrassment for dictators, when they didn’t know what happened,” Biden saidat the time. The response from Beijing in June was swift and angry. “The remarks seriously contradict basic facts, seriously violate diplomatic etiquette, and seriously infringe on China’s political dignity,” the spokesperson for the foreign ministry said. Wednesday’s comment could threaten to derail the positive energy coming out of the meeting, which Biden described earlier in the news conference as “some of the most constructive and productive discussions we’ve had.” Biden cultivated a deep relationship with Xi during their time as vice presidents and still appear to have a warm personal relationship, even as US-China relations have since deteriorated. He even wished the Chinese leader’s wife a happy birthday during their talks, a senior US official told News Agency. “I know the man, I know his modus operandi,  looked into his eyes – we have disagreements. He has a different view than I have on a lot of things, but he’s been straight. I don’t mean that good, better, indifferent, just straight,” he said. For his part, Xi called on the United States to “not scheme to suppress or contain China” during Wednesday’s extensive talks, Chinese state media reported. “China has no plans to surpass or unseat the United States, and the United States should not scheme to suppress or contain China,” Xi said, according to a readout released by China’s state news agency Xinhua. “Both sides should understand each other’s principles and bottom lines, not make or stir up trouble or cross boundaries, (but instead) communicate more, have more dialogue and more discussions, and handle differences and accidents calmly,” Xi said. The two leaders “emphasized the need for mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, maintaining communication and conflict prevention” during the meeting, according to Xinhua.

Glasgow, Scotland –The atmosphere at Celtic Park on European nights needs few added extras, the electricity in the air on such occasions is enough to light up the Glasgow skyline several times over. But as 60,000 Celtic fans flocked to the famous arena last Wednesday evening for the Champions League tie against Atletico Madrid, it was not just anticipation for the game powering the pre-match energy. As kickoff neared, the stadium transformed into asea of Palestinian flags, every stand awash with the colours of Palestine in a show of solidarity with those in Gaza underIsraeli assault. A few days before, when Celtic fans displayed Palestinian flags at a domestic away fixture, television networks were accused of purposefully avoiding the display. They had no such option this time. The display was beamed around the world, and quickly shared millions of times on social media. The main flag bearers, literally and figuratively, arethe Green Brigade– an “ultras” group formed in 2006, renowned for their Irish Republicanism and unflinching support for the Palestinian cause. It’s a position that has attracted many admirers but often puts them atloggerheads with the club’s board, which is more politically conservative than the fanbase.      Fearful of penalties from football’s governing bodies, the club urged fans not to heed the Green Brigade’s call to show support for Palestine at the Atletico Madrid game, releasing a statement asking “that banners, flags and symbols relating to the conflict and those countries involved in it are not displayed at Celtic Park at this time”. A few days prior to the match, in an apparent warning to the group, Celtic banned the Green Brigade from all away games. Following the display against Atletico Madrid, that ban has been extended to all home games. In a letter to fans, the club outlined several reasons for the ban, including anti-social behaviour, the use of pyrotechnics and crucially “against Atletico Madrid, another unauthorised display, breaching the restrictions previously communicated”. For the Green Brigade, there’s little doubt that it was the Palestine display which has led to the ban. “The other issues are a smokescreen,” the Green Brigade told News Agency. “The club are very clever and cynical. They want to sanction us, they want to punish us. They want to send us a message to try to keep us in line and deter us from doing further action. But they know very well that on the issue of Palestine, they’re not on strong ground as they don’t have a lot of support amongst the wider fanbase on that issue. So they’re using other issues that they think they will have support on to sanction us.” The Green Brigade also told News Agency that senior Celtic officials had previously told them privately that they were most concerned with “their corporate image and corporate responsibilities” to shareholders. “But we’re unashamed of and unequivocal of our support for Palestine and that will continue,” the group said. “And once again the wider Celtic support showed that they too had the courage and conviction to stand and be counted. To side with the right side of history and voice support for the underdog, which in this case is the Palestinians.” The club did not respond to News Agency’s requests for comment.      For those familiar with Celtic’s origin story, as a club born from the Irish Catholic diaspora in Scotland, the fans’ solidarity with the assault on Gaza was no surprise. Support for left-wing, anti-imperialist causes among the fanbase is common. Banning the Green Brigades is a risky escalation by the club, as the group are popular among the wider Celtic support. Indeed, flags supporting Palestine at Celtic Park predate the group’s formation. Both the shareholders group The Celtic Trust and fellow ultras group Bhoys Celtic have condemned the ban, with the latter staging a walkout in protest at the recent game against St Mirren. “There will be no return to normality from us while this absurd and entirely avoidable situation is allowed to continue,” Bhoys Celtic said in a statement, suggesting that further walkouts or boycotts could take place. With the ban on the 300 or so supporters being indefinite “pending further review”, the situation leaves Celtic a club at civil war at a crucial time in the season. Some fans believe their political displays can occasionally go too far, but all agree that their absence will negatively impact the atmosphere at games. There is also precedent for Celtic fans uniting on theissue of Palestine. When the Green Brigade showed support for Palestine in a tie against the Israeli club Hapoel Be’er Sheva in 2016, the club were fined by UEFA for the display of “illicit banners”. The wider fanbase swung behind a fundraising campaign; not to pay the fine, but to support charities in Palestine. More than 175,000 pounds ($214,000) was raised, which helped to fund the formation of Aida Celtic, a football team in Aida refugee camp in Bethlehem, the occupied West Bank. The links established then have solidified in the seven years since, with regular exchange visits made as part of a deepening of fans’ education of the Palestine issue. Indeed, while the Celtic board may have shifted uncomfortably in their seats as they saw the Palestinian flags unfurled last Wednesday, the intended recipients of the gesture, the people of Gaza, welcomed it warmly. “We thank Celtic fans for this stand and for their ongoing solidarity to the Palestinian people in Gaza,” Hazem Tabash, the manager of the Benn’a Sports Club in Gaza told News Agency, who saw the images online despite Israel’s communication blackouts and widespread bombing in the besieged territory. The Benn’a youth centre’s footballers have played previously in green and white hoops of Celtic. But its pitch currently lies desolate, if not destroyed. Located near the border fence in the eastern Gaza Strip, all staff and volunteers were forced to flee when the Israeli bombing started on October 7, afterHamas launched deadly attacksin Israel that killed 1,405 people, most of whom were Israeli civilians. Israel’s retaliatory attacks have killed atleast 9,061 people, including 3,760 children. “[The fans’] actions are important to raise awareness of the public in Western countries where governments give Israel full support to continue its crimes against Palestinians in Gaza,” Tabash said of the display at Celtic Park. “They also help to support us Palestinians on the ground, giving us some hope that we are not alone. “I call for all fans who believe in justice and freedom to follow the steps of Celtic fans and ask your governments to act immediately to stop this genocide and stop the double standards and the bias when it comes to the Palestine-Israel conflict.”      Accusations of double standards relate not just to how governments are acting on this matter, but also to football authorities. There was widespread support for Ukraine in the footballing world when it was invaded by Russia last year. Indeed, Russian clubs were even banned from European competition. But a very different approach is taken to any display of support for Palestinians. “Why are the football authorities uncomfortable with football fans expressing solidarity with the Palestinian people?” said David Webber, a senior research fellow at Solent University specialising in football and politics. “UEFA and FIFA were quite quick to exclude Russia from international competition and club competition. But we don’t see that same treatment of Israel. Does it really just boil down to the fact the Palestinians are brown and not white?” “It’s all part of trying to neutralise football as a product but what that does is it starves the game of its authenticity. The values that the fans have matter and are inextricable to the clubs they support.

Glasgow, Scotland –The atmosphere at Celtic Park on European nights needs few added extras, the electricity in the air on such occasions is enough to light up the Glasgow skyline several times over. But as 60,000 Celtic fans flocked to the famous arena last Wednesday evening for the Champions League tie against Atletico Madrid, it was not just anticipation for the game powering the pre-match energy. As kickoff neared, the stadium transformed into asea of Palestinian flags, every stand awash with the colours of Palestine in a show of solidarity with those in Gaza underIsraeli assault. A few days before, when Celtic fans displayed Palestinian flags at a domestic away fixture, television networks were accused of purposefully avoiding the display. They had no such option this time. The display was beamed around the world, and quickly shared millions of times on social media. The main flag bearers, literally and figuratively, arethe Green Brigade– an “ultras” group formed in 2006, renowned for their Irish Republicanism and unflinching support for the Palestinian cause. It’s a position that has attracted many admirers but often puts them atloggerheads with the club’s board, which is more politically conservative than the fanbase.      Fearful of penalties from football’s governing bodies, the club urged fans not to heed the Green Brigade’s call to show support for Palestine at the Atletico Madrid game, releasing a statement asking “that banners, flags and symbols relating to the conflict and those countries involved in it are not displayed at Celtic Park at this time”. A few days prior to the match, in an apparent warning to the group, Celtic banned the Green Brigade from all away games. Following the display against Atletico Madrid, that ban has been extended to all home games. In a letter to fans, the club outlined several reasons for the ban, including anti-social behaviour, the use of pyrotechnics and crucially “against Atletico Madrid, another unauthorised display, breaching the restrictions previously communicated”. For the Green Brigade, there’s little doubt that it was the Palestine display which has led to the ban. “The other issues are a smokescreen,” the Green Brigade told News Agency. “The club are very clever and cynical. They want to sanction us, they want to punish us. They want to send us a message to try to keep us in line and deter us from doing further action. But they know very well that on the issue of Palestine, they’re not on strong ground as they don’t have a lot of support amongst the wider fanbase on that issue. So they’re using other issues that they think they will have support on to sanction us.” The Green Brigade also told News Agency that senior Celtic officials had previously told them privately that they were most concerned with “their corporate image and corporate responsibilities” to shareholders. “But we’re unashamed of and unequivocal of our support for Palestine and that will continue,” the group said. “And once again the wider Celtic support showed that they too had the courage and conviction to stand and be counted. To side with the right side of history and voice support for the underdog, which in this case is the Palestinians.” The club did not respond to News Agency’s requests for comment.      For those familiar with Celtic’s origin story, as a club born from the Irish Catholic diaspora in Scotland, the fans’ solidarity with the assault on Gaza was no surprise. Support for left-wing, anti-imperialist causes among the fanbase is common. Banning the Green Brigades is a risky escalation by the club, as the group are popular among the wider Celtic support. Indeed, flags supporting Palestine at Celtic Park predate the group’s formation. Both the shareholders group The Celtic Trust and fellow ultras group Bhoys Celtic have condemned the ban, with the latter staging a walkout in protest at the recent game against St Mirren. “There will be no return to normality from us while this absurd and entirely avoidable situation is allowed to continue,” Bhoys Celtic said in a statement, suggesting that further walkouts or boycotts could take place. With the ban on the 300 or so supporters being indefinite “pending further review”, the situation leaves Celtic a club at civil war at a crucial time in the season. Some fans believe their political displays can occasionally go too far, but all agree that their absence will negatively impact the atmosphere at games. There is also precedent for Celtic fans uniting on theissue of Palestine. When the Green Brigade showed support for Palestine in a tie against the Israeli club Hapoel Be’er Sheva in 2016, the club were fined by UEFA for the display of “illicit banners”. The wider fanbase swung behind a fundraising campaign; not to pay the fine, but to support charities in Palestine. More than 175,000 pounds ($214,000) was raised, which helped to fund the formation of Aida Celtic, a football team in Aida refugee camp in Bethlehem, the occupied West Bank. The links established then have solidified in the seven years since, with regular exchange visits made as part of a deepening of fans’ education of the Palestine issue. Indeed, while the Celtic board may have shifted uncomfortably in their seats as they saw the Palestinian flags unfurled last Wednesday, the intended recipients of the gesture, the people of Gaza, welcomed it warmly. “We thank Celtic fans for this stand and for their ongoing solidarity to the Palestinian people in Gaza,” Hazem Tabash, the manager of the Benn’a Sports Club in Gaza told News Agency, who saw the images online despite Israel’s communication blackouts and widespread bombing in the besieged territory. The Benn’a youth centre’s footballers have played previously in green and white hoops of Celtic. But its pitch currently lies desolate, if not destroyed. Located near the border fence in the eastern Gaza Strip, all staff and volunteers were forced to flee when the Israeli bombing started on October 7, afterHamas launched deadly attacksin Israel that killed 1,405 people, most of whom were Israeli civilians. Israel’s retaliatory attacks have killed atleast 9,061 people, including 3,760 children. “[The fans’] actions are important to raise awareness of the public in Western countries where governments give Israel full support to continue its crimes against Palestinians in Gaza,” Tabash said of the display at Celtic Park. “They also help to support us Palestinians on the ground, giving us some hope that we are not alone. “I call for all fans who believe in justice and freedom to follow the steps of Celtic fans and ask your governments to act immediately to stop this genocide and stop the double standards and the bias when it comes to the Palestine-Israel conflict.”      Accusations of double standards relate not just to how governments are acting on this matter, but also to football authorities. There was widespread support for Ukraine in the footballing world when it was invaded by Russia last year. Indeed, Russian clubs were even banned from European competition. But a very different approach is taken to any display of support for Palestinians. “Why are the football authorities uncomfortable with football fans expressing solidarity with the Palestinian people?” said David Webber, a senior research fellow at Solent University specialising in football and politics. “UEFA and FIFA were quite quick to exclude Russia from international competition and club competition. But we don’t see that same treatment of Israel. Does it really just boil down to the fact the Palestinians are brown and not white?” “It’s all part of trying to neutralise football as a product but what that does is it starves the game of its authenticity. The values that the fans have matter and are inextricable to the clubs they support. However much the clubs might want to expunge it, these values are not just left at the turnstile.” The Green Brigade, meanwhile, told News Agency they intend to stick to their motto: Until The Last Rebel. “The political class like to tell working-class people that they don’t know what they’re talking about or that they can’t have an opinion on certain issues,” they said. “We’re a proudly politically conscious group.

The trial in jail of Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Imran Khan has been declared illegal by a court, his lawyer has said. On Tuesday, lawyer Naeem Panjutha posted on social media that a court in Islamabad ruled against an in-jail trial for Khan,indicted last monthon charges of revealing state secrets after he was ousted from office in 2022. “Islamabad High Court has declared illegal the notification for jail trial,” Panjutha said in a post on X. The impact of that declaration regarding Khan’s trial is not yet clear, but is expected to be clarified by a court order. The trial against Khan, accused of publicising a classified diplomatic cable, has become a flashpoint in Pakistani politics, where the former leader remains popular and has characterised the charges against him as an effort by powerful interests to keep himout of office.      The 70-year-old former cricket star was expelled from office by ano-confidence votein parliament in April 2022, an effort Khan accused of being pushed along by the United States. Relations between Washington and Khan had become strained by issues such as the war in Ukraine, but the US has denied any involvement in his removal from office. In October, Khan was indicted on security charges that accused him of leaking a diplomatic cable between Washington and Islamabad that Khan says offers proof ofcollusion against him. Since his ouster last year, Khan has faced a slew of legal challenges, with the charges against him ranging from contempt of court to “terrorism” andblasphemy.

The impact of that declaration regarding Khan’s trial is not yet clear, but is expected to be clarified by a court order. The trial against Khan, accused of publicising a classified diplomatic cable, has become a flashpoint in Pakistani politics, where the former leader remains popular and has characterised the charges against him as an effort by powerful interests to keep himout of office.      The 70-year-old former cricket star was expelled from office by ano-confidence votein parliament in April 2022, an effort Khan accused of being pushed along by the United States. Relations between Washington and Khan had become strained by issues such as the war in Ukraine, but the US has denied any involvement in his removal from office. In October, Khan was indicted on security charges that accused him of leaking a diplomatic cable between Washington and Islamabad that Khan says offers proof ofcollusion against him. Since his ouster last year, Khan has faced a slew of legal challenges, with the charges against him ranging from contempt of court to “terrorism” andblasphemy.

Belfast, Northern Ireland –Juan Manuel Santos, who served as Colombia’s president between 2010 and 2018, was and remains a key figure in the country’s ongoing conflict resolution process. He was awarded the 2016 Nobel Peace Prize for, the committee said, his “resolute efforts to bring the country’s more than 50-year-long civil war to an end, a war that has cost the lives of at least 220,000 Colombians and displaced close to six million people”. Santos oversaw the 2016 peace agreement between the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the government, concluding the armed conflict. News Agency interviewed Santos at the One Young World 2023 summit last month in Belfast, to speak about the lessons learned in Colombia from Northern Ireland’s peace process and where transitional justice efforts stand respectively in the two territories. News Agency: What significance does the Northern Ireland peace process have for the conflict resolution efforts you have spearheaded in Colombia? Juan Manuel Santos:The peace process here was in a way an inspiration for us. It was a conflict that had lasted for so many years and finally ended. I copied other aspects of the Northern Ireland peace agreement – for example, the back-channelling and the confidentiality at the beginning. With the help of international advisers who were not engaged in the day-to-day of Colombian politics, I said, “This is what we must do.” And that blueprint was extremely, extremely useful. But we also learned what not to do. For example, the Northern Ireland peace agreement did not give importance to implementation. And I think we learned that we should – that’s why we included implementation as a specific point in the Colombian peace process. Another thing that was not done here, which we did do in Colombia, was putting victims at the centre of negotiations. If you do this – their rights to justice, their rights to the truth, their rights to justice and non-repetition – that helps tremendously the process of healing the wounds of war that has been going on for so long. Today, you see generals of the Colombian military facing victims and admitting that they committed war crimes and crimes against humanity – that they killed their sons, without any reason. And to see that! People thought that would never happen, but it is happening right now. Part of the tensions that are still present here in Northern Ireland, 25 years after, is because you did not do what we did in Colombia. We’re going through this very difficult process at the moment of trying to heal the wounds created by so many years of war. It’s not an easy task, but it’s a necessary one if you want a sustainable peace in the long run. News Agency: This has been brought into sharp focus here by the British government’s newNorthern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill. How have you viewed developments around it? Santos:That’s one of the consequences of not having a transitional justice system like the one we have in Colombia. We built that in order precisely to avoid the problems you are having here, 25 years later, with the British government. It has been trying to pass a law that will give [an effective] amnesty to the people responsible for war crimes – for many people this is, of course, unacceptable. If you had had a transitional justice [structure or framework ], these types of problems would not appear 25 years later. The Colombian peace process is the only peace process in the world where the two [warring] parties agreed to create a special tribunal and to submit to it. Usually, it is a tribunal that is imposed from the outside – by the United Nations, or whatever [body] – but never had two parties created their own process [transitional justice mechanism] and submitted to it in this way. The international community is less and less prone to accepting amnesties for war criminals and crimes against humanity – this can appear to make peace deals harder to apply, but it makes sense when you come to try and heal the wounds, a fundamental part of any peace process. News Agency: Where is the Colombian peace process poised now? Santos:Unfortunately, my successor [Ivan Duque Marquez] – who was against the peace process – dragged his feet in the implementation of the peace process. This was very damaging and had there been an earlier implementation with the FARC, the much-needed process of healing our society’s wounds would have got under way much faster. The president of this new government [Gustavo Petro] has promised that he will implement the peace process, and I hope he does. Because his idea of building what he calls “total peace” has to be done using the peace process that was signed with the FARC as a necessary condition. Without doing that, his efforts will fail. So what I hope – and what I’m asking for – is to accelerate the implementation of the peace process that was signed several years ago. Because that would give him the legitimacy and the credibility to build on that process. If he thinks he can build a new peace process without implementing what has already been [agreed and] signed, then he will fail. The Colombian peace process was probably the most ambitious peace process ever signed, and it’s been described [externally] in those terms. We did not only address the DDR – demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration – but we also addressed the causes of the conflict. We went much further to negotiate, for example, agrarian reform that this government is trying to put in place and that the last government put on hold. We went much further to try to find a solution to the drug-trafficking problem – which the last government also put on hold and we’re still suffering the consequences of that. We even had an ethnic chapter, a gender chapter – which has not been implemented fully yet. If you do all of that, it is a marvellous programme for any government. So, if the Petro administration simply does [all of] that, he will be considered a good president when they finish. But if he, in a way, concentrates on his [idea of] “total peace” at the expense of what has been [agreed and] signed [already], then he will be in trouble.

It has been trying to pass a law that will give [an effective] amnesty to the people responsible for war crimes – for many people this is, of course, unacceptable. If you had had a transitional justice [structure or framework ], these types of problems would not appear 25 years later. The Colombian peace process is the only peace process in the world where the two [warring] parties agreed to create a special tribunal and to submit to it. Usually, it is a tribunal that is imposed from the outside – by the United Nations, or whatever [body] – but never had two parties created their own process [transitional justice mechanism] and submitted to it in this way. The international community is less and less prone to accepting amnesties for war criminals and crimes against humanity – this can appear to make peace deals harder to apply, but it makes sense when you come to try and heal the wounds, a fundamental part of any peace process. News Agency: Where is the Colombian peace process poised now? Santos:Unfortunately, my successor [Ivan Duque Marquez] – who was against the peace process – dragged his feet in the implementation of the peace process. This was very damaging and had there been an earlier implementation with the FARC, the much-needed process of healing our society’s wounds would have got under way much faster. The president of this new government [Gustavo Petro] has promised that he will implement the peace process, and I hope he does. Because his idea of building what he calls “total peace” has to be done using the peace process that was signed with the FARC as a necessary condition. Without doing that, his efforts will fail. So what I hope – and what I’m asking for – is to accelerate the implementation of the peace process that was signed several years ago. Because that would give him the legitimacy and the credibility to build on that process. If he thinks he can build a new peace process without implementing what has already been [agreed and] signed, then he will fail. The Colombian peace process was probably the most ambitious peace process ever signed, and it’s been described [externally] in those terms. We did not only address the DDR – demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration – but we also addressed the causes of the conflict. We went much further to negotiate, for example, agrarian reform that this government is trying to put in place and that the last government put on hold. We went much further to try to find a solution to the drug-trafficking problem – which the last government also put on hold and we’re still suffering the consequences of that. We even had an ethnic chapter, a gender chapter – which has not been implemented fully yet. If you do all of that, it is a marvellous programme for any government. So, if the Petro administration simply does [all of] that, he will be considered a good president when they finish. But if he, in a way, concentrates on his [idea of] “total peace” at the expense of what has been [agreed and] signed [already], then he will be in trouble.

The talks aren’t likely to produce a major thaw in the world’s most consequential bilateral relationship. Instead, the fact that the meeting is happening at all is viewed by White House aides as a positive sign after months of friction. US officials said the leaders hoped to develop a “framework” for managing successful competitive relations between the two powers, with the goal of clearing up misperceptions and avoiding surprises.

Restoring a degree of stability to the Washington-Beijing relationship has been among his top foreign policy priorities, even as global tensions flare. The list of issues expected to arise in the talks is long. It includes restoring military-to-military communication between the two countries, a chief objective for Biden, who plans to press Xi on the issue. Also on the table are the conflicts in Israel and Ukraine; areas of potential cooperation like climate change and countering narcotics trafficking; and deep disagreements over human rights issues and military escalation in the South China Sea and around Taiwan. The meeting, which will occur amid a large gathering of Pacific leaders in California, has been months in the making and required intensive preparations on both sides. American officials expected China to formally announce Xi’s participation Friday morning Eastern Time. The US officials said the talks would be expansive and spread out over multiple working sessions. Despite a deep and apparently warm personal relationship cultivated during their time as vice presidents, Biden and Xi have overseen a deterioration in US-China relations to the lowest level in decades. The sticking points include Taiwan, the self-governing island that China’s Communist Party claims as its own, and which it has vowed to take by force if necessary. The island will hold an election in January, ramping up sensitivities around its status. The relationship has also been strained by new limits Biden imposed on advanced technology exported to China in the name of protecting US national security. And the US has pressured China to play a more constructive role in both the Israel-Hamas conflict and the Russia-Ukraine war, encouraging the country to step up its role on the world stage. “Right now, neither the United States nor China are entering the meeting between President Biden and President Xi expecting to significantly improve or reset the relationship,” said Bonny Lin, director of the China Power Project and senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Rather, the meeting will be about managing and stabilizing the bilateral relationship, improving communication, and reducing misunderstandings before they occur.” Wednesday’s summit will be only the second time Biden and Xi have met in person over the last three years. They last came face-to-face a year ago on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Bali. That meeting was intended to establish a baseline for the relationship amid heightened economic and military tension. Departing the Indonesian island, the two sides did appear on track to engage in more regular talks. But months later, a standoff over a suspected Chinese spy balloon scuttled hopes for normalizing ties. Following a visit to Taiwan last summer by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Beijing abruptly cut off communication with the US military, causing worry among American officials about the prospect of miscommunication or miscalculation in the tense contested areas of the South China Sea or around Taiwan. Attempts to restore the military channels have been halting, even as a steady stream of Biden administration officials have visited Beijing, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.

Beirut, Lebanon– Hezbollah is well aware of Lebanon’s public opinion on widening the war with Israel for its relentless bombardment of the Gaza Strip since Hamas launched an attack on Israel onOctober 7, and that it has to tread carefully, analysts say. In spite ofHezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah’scareful mixing of condemnations of Israel with words of restraint in a speech on Saturday, Israel’s defence minister issued dire warnings against the Lebanese people. Following that, there was a noticeable escalation in the attacks, which had started on October 8, between the two. Hezbollah launched attacks first, at Israeli positions in theShebaa Farms, which it considers occupied Lebanese land. Many wondered if this meant Hezbollah would enter the battle fully, but there was silence from its Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah who waited weeks and then gave two speeches in eight days. On November 11, Nasrallah spoke with relative restraint in his second speech, telling viewers that Hezbollah would expand its attacks on Israel to match their abuses of Palestinians or attacks on Lebanon but did not want to provoke a wider war. The mismatch between Nasrallah’s tone and Israel’s response – promising to do to Beirut what it had done to Gaza – has raised questions including whether Israeli leaders have sensed some kind of hesitance or reluctance on the part of Nasrallah. There has been a significant Palestinian presence in Lebanon since the 1967 war when large numbers of refugees came there seeking asylum. Palestinian fighters from the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) used Lebanese territory to launch attacks on Israel, drawing retaliation and eventually becoming involved in the Lebanese Civil War from 1975 to 1990. As such, some Lebanese communities retain a combination of trauma and animosity towards Palestinians. But even among those groups, there is widespread opposition to Israeli military actions against civilians in Gaza. The confrontation with Israel seems to have reinvigorated Hezbollah, which seems more in tune than at any point since 2006. Still, despite that, Nasrallah and party leadership cadres will be making efforts to show the group as a rational actor that will not callously enter a wider war with Israel, analysts told News Agency. “Hezbollah does not have the same support they had in 2006,” Joseph Daher, author of Hezbollah: The Political Economy of Lebanon’s Party of God, told News Agency. “Socially and politically they are much more isolated.” InJuly 2006, Hezbollah and Israel fought a 34-day war that killed 1,150 people, mostly Lebanese civilians. Despite the damage and loss of Lebanese lives, the war was considered a draw, sending Hezbollah’s regional popularity soaring for their ability to confront Israel’s military power. But in subsequent years, a series of domestic confrontations and their intervention in the Syrian civil war have eroded Hezbollah’s popular support outside their base. In 2008, Hezbollah took over West Beirut when the Lebanese government attempted to dismantle its telecommunications network, angering many outside their direct support base. The party also saw dissent from past supporters during the2019 October protestsagainst the deteriorating situation in Lebanon. In hisspeechon Saturday, Nasrallah cited “dissenting voices in Lebanon”, which could include figures like Prime Minister Najib Mikati and Druze community leader Walid Jumblatt, who have called to keep Lebanon out of a wider confrontation with Israel. Some observers believe Nasrallah was referring to Lebanese Forces party leader Samir Geagea. The right-wing nationalist Lebanese Forces are staunch opponents of Hezbollah and decry the group’s arms as undermining the centrality of the Lebanese state and the government’s power. While they aren’t an existential threat to Hezbollah, the group is aware of their opponent’s sentiments. “Hezbollah doesn’t see the Lebanese Forces as a military threat,” Nicholas Noe, who edited Voice of Hezbollah: The Statements of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, said. “But they are a factor in their wider thinking.” The Forces resent Hezbollah’s ability to wage war without the backing of the state but they and their allies have chosen not to be particularly vocal at this moment in time, Daher said. “Hezbollah doesn’t want the war right now but if it comes … then so be it,” Noe said, adding that it is important for Hezbollah to show that if the war expands to the rest of Lebanon, it wasn’t due to “Hezbollah’s stupid mistakes or bald provocation”. Whether this contributes to Israel’s belligerent language towards its northern neighbour, counting on the fact that Hezbollah will do everything it can to stay out of a big war, remains to be seen. For the time being, Hezbollah’s calculations on the border with Israel are linked to military considerations in Gaza, according to Amal Saad Ghorayeb, author of Hizbu’llah: Politics and Religion. And those calculations are strategically linked to Israel’s effectiveness in fighting Hamas, rather than civilian death tolls, Ghorayeb added. Should Hamas be routed in Gaza, Hezbollah worries Israel will turn its attention to Lebanon, and so its strategy has been to divide the Israeli military’s attention, pulling the force of its full arsenal away from Gaza. Hezbollah will prolong that tactic until the fighting in Gaza stops, according to Nasrallah. But a wider war would benefit neither Hezbollah nor its partner Iran. A lot of analysis on Hezbollah has painted the group as beholden to Iran but it is wrong to call Hezbollah an Iranian puppet, Daher said. “Hezbollah, like Hamas, has agency and they discuss their options with Iran.” Analysts – and a 2019reportby the think tank International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) – agree, saying Hezbollah acts in its own interests, despite enjoying support, coordination and collaboration with Iran. In short, these analyses agree, Hezbollah isn’t waiting on Iran’s orders, though Iran might be advising their allies to do all they can to avoid expanding the war. “Iran doesn’t want to lose Hezbollah, their crown jewel in the regional network of their influence,” Daher said.

Beirut, Lebanon– Hezbollah is well aware of Lebanon’s public opinion on widening the war with Israel for its relentless bombardment of the Gaza Strip since Hamas launched an attack on Israel onOctober 7, and that it has to tread carefully, analysts say. In spite ofHezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah’scareful mixing of condemnations of Israel with words of restraint in a speech on Saturday, Israel’s defence minister issued dire warnings against the Lebanese people. Following that, there was a noticeable escalation in the attacks, which had started on October 8, between the two. Hezbollah launched attacks first, at Israeli positions in theShebaa Farms, which it considers occupied Lebanese land. Many wondered if this meant Hezbollah would enter the battle fully, but there was silence from its Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah who waited weeks and then gave two speeches in eight days. On November 11, Nasrallah spoke with relative restraint in his second speech, telling viewers that Hezbollah would expand its attacks on Israel to match their abuses of Palestinians or attacks on Lebanon but did not want to provoke a wider war. The mismatch between Nasrallah’s tone and Israel’s response – promising to do to Beirut what it had done to Gaza – has raised questions including whether Israeli leaders have sensed some kind of hesitance or reluctance on the part of Nasrallah. There has been a significant Palestinian presence in Lebanon since the 1967 war when large numbers of refugees came there seeking asylum. Palestinian fighters from the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) used Lebanese territory to launch attacks on Israel, drawing retaliation and eventually becoming involved in the Lebanese Civil War from 1975 to 1990. As such, some Lebanese communities retain a combination of trauma and animosity towards Palestinians. But even among those groups, there is widespread opposition to Israeli military actions against civilians in Gaza.

In a landmark move, the eastern Indian state of Bihar has announced the findings of the first-ever caste census since the country’s independence in 1947. The survey found that over two-thirds of the state’s population of over 130 million belonged to “backward” or marginalised communities. As part of the decades-old government affirmative action, marginalised communities have been categorised as backward, extremely backward, scheduled caste (the former “untouchables”) and scheduled tribe (the Indigenous communities). India isone of the most unequal countriesin the world with the bulk of the resources and jobs controlled by the privileged castes. The findings from Bihar, one of India’s poorest yet politically significant states, have the potential to upend the country’s politics, with demands being made for a similar nationwide census, opening the doors for a revamp of the country’s affirmative action plans amid calls to grant proportional benefits to marginalised castes in line with their share of the population. These demands, however, threaten to weaken Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Hindu nationalist party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s hold over many of these marginalised castes, just months before the 2024 general elections. While India’s majority Hindu community has been traditionally stratified into various castes, there has been no accurate data for decades now about the population of these castes and subcastes. The last time a caste census was carried out was in 1931 when India was still under British colonial rule. The findings of a nationwide census in 2011 were never made public. The lack of recent data meant affirmative action was insufficient and, often, misguided. For instance, the Bihar caste census data show that its dominant castes comprise just 15.5 percent, while its marginalised castes make up for a staggering 84 percent of the state’s population. Despite this, affirmative action for these marginalised castes has been limited – only 50 percent of government jobs and educational opportunities are reserved for them. Bihar’s move to make this data public is likely to trigger campaigns across the country from marginalised communities, to revisit affirmative action policies. In the process, these campaigns could cause political upheavals in the country. It has been known that India’s marginalised castes are disadvantaged and suffer from lack of opportunities. They suffer widespread discrimination as well as stigmatisation, though untouchability was abolished right after India gained independence. The new data, while reiterating this, offer a glimpse into the massive scale of the problem. It goes a step towards reiterating that marginalised castes are the most dominant bloc in India’s social structure, and yet, remain deprived and discriminated against. “The data reiterates how a small proportion of the dominant castes have occupied and controlled everything, from politics to its media to businesses,” said Yashwant Zagade, a research scholar studying politics of the backward castes, at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS). India has emerged as the fifth largest economy in the world but the gap between richest and poorest people is huge. Oxfam India inits 2023 reportsaid that 60 percent of the country’s wealth is held by the richest 5 percent of citizens. India’s opposition parties, part of a coalition called INDIA, have been pushing for a similar caste census to be carried out across the country. After a decade of electoral marginalisation, the opposition parties are now trying to challenge BJP’s politics of Hindutva (Hindu-ness), highlighting the rising inequality and corporate control of resources. Opposition leader from the Congress Party, Rahul Gandhi, has been repeatedly insisting on proportionate representation of marginalised communities in getting their due rights, as per their share of the population. After having been criticised for failing to present an alternative vision for the country, the opposition parties seemed to have found their mojo, in taking on Modi and his BJP through this issue. An overwhelming majority of Indians belong to marginalised castes. A 2021 Pew survey had found this to be at 69 percent of India’s total population. By championing their cause, the opposition alliance hopes to woo them, broaden its popular base and defeat the dominant BJP, which has won two comfortable majorities since 2014. Secondly, Modi has been trying to blur caste lines and, instead, consolidate support for a unified Hindu identity, as part of his party’s Hindutva agenda that has polarised Indians along religious and ethnic lines. The BJP has been criticised for its dog whistle politics against Muslims who form about 15 percent of India’s 1.4 billion people. The new caste-based movements threaten to derail these attempts, experts say. “The demand for a caste census can create a new caste consciousness among the various marginalised castes and can threaten the BJP’s Hindutva project,” said Zagade. “If caste becomes the central issue, it will push Hindutva away,” he added. In its dominance over the last decade, Modi’s BJP has sought to create a diverse voter base among Hindus, consisting of both dominant and marginalised castes, including tribals and Dalits. Modi, himself belonging to a “backward caste” community, has reiterated his caste identity in public meetings to draw in support. However, an opposition campaign to push for greater rights for India’s marginalised castes could see Modi’s support base cracking. “In the 2022 elections in Uttar Pradesh, Modi’s other backward caste (OBC) vote declined. Hence, the BJP will be worried that this new development could fracture its vote further,” said Sudha Pai, political scientist and author of a new book that studies the BJP’s grip over Dalit politics. Dalits, the former untouchables, lie at the bottom of the complex Hindu caste hierarchy. History might worry Modi and his aides, too. In the early 1990s, the BJP’s attempts to come to power through a communally-charged campaign to build a temple at the purported site of the birth of Hindu god Ram was undercut by the Mandal movement, which demanded greater opportunities and affirmative action for OBCs. The Mandal movement denied the BJP power for at least a decade. The opposition parties are hoping for an encore. As a result, while most other parties, including some of the BJP’s allies, have pushed for a national caste census, the BJP has remained shy of embracing this demand. Modi, on the day the findings of the census were revealed, the opposition parties of “committing the sin” of “dividing the country on caste lines”.      Most observers believe it is too early to tell how the issue will pan out, but either way, caste identities will be “one of the major poles” in the 2024 general elections when India elects a new government, said Pai. Zagade, the scholar, said that while the opposition parties seem keen to make a nationwide caste census their principal point of campaign, their efforts on the ground will decide whether it strikes a chord with intended beneficiaries. “Political parties will have to build the momentum on the issue, create an awareness among voters about how such caste data could benefit them,” he added. Experts believe a data-driven conversation around caste will enable a rightful distribution of resources and opportunities to those who need it the most. “Thanks to these conversations, we will see more welfare programmes for the backward castes, more budgetary allocations for them,” Pai added.

In a landmark move, the eastern Indian state of Bihar has announced the findings of the first-ever caste census since the country’s independence in 1947. The survey found that over two-thirds of the state’s population of over 130 million belonged to “backward” or marginalised communities. As part of the decades-old government affirmative action, marginalised communities have been categorised as backward, extremely backward, scheduled caste (the former “untouchables”) and scheduled tribe (the Indigenous communities). India isone of the most unequal countriesin the world with the bulk of the resources and jobs controlled by the privileged castes. The findings from Bihar, one of India’s poorest yet politically significant states, have the potential to upend the country’s politics, with demands being made for a similar nationwide census, opening the doors for a revamp of the country’s affirmative action plans amid calls to grant proportional benefits to marginalised castes in line with their share of the population. These demands, however, threaten to weaken Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Hindu nationalist party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s hold over many of these marginalised castes, just months before the 2024 general elections. While India’s majority Hindu community has been traditionally stratified into various castes, there has been no accurate data for decades now about the population of these castes and subcastes. The last time a caste census was carried out was in 1931 when India was still under British colonial rule. The findings of a nationwide census in 2011 were never made public. The lack of recent data meant affirmative action was insufficient and, often, misguided. For instance, the Bihar caste census data show that its dominant castes comprise just 15.5 percent, while its marginalised castes make up for a staggering 84 percent of the state’s population. Despite this, affirmative action for these marginalised castes has been limited – only 50 percent of government jobs and educational opportunities are reserved for them. Bihar’s move to make this data public is likely to trigger campaigns across the country from marginalised communities, to revisit affirmative action policies. In the process, these campaigns could cause political upheavals in the country. It has been known that India’s marginalised castes are disadvantaged and suffer from lack of opportunities. They suffer widespread discrimination as well as stigmatisation, though untouchability was abolished right after India gained independence. The new data, while reiterating this, offer a glimpse into the massive scale of the problem. It goes a step towards reiterating that marginalised castes are the most dominant bloc in India’s social structure, and yet, remain deprived and discriminated against. “The data reiterates how a small proportion of the dominant castes have occupied and controlled everything, from politics to its media to businesses,” said Yashwant Zagade, a research scholar studying politics of the backward castes, at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS). India has emerged as the fifth largest economy in the world but the gap between richest and poorest people is huge. Oxfam India inits 2023 reportsaid that 60 percent of the country’s wealth is held by the richest 5 percent of citizens. India’s opposition parties, part of a coalition called INDIA, have been pushing for a similar caste census to be carried out across the country. After a decade of electoral marginalisation, the opposition parties are now trying to challenge BJP’s politics of Hindutva (Hindu-ness), highlighting the rising inequality and corporate control of resources. Opposition leader from the Congress Party, Rahul Gandhi, has been repeatedly insisting on proportionate representation of marginalised communities in getting their due rights, as per their share of the population. After having been criticised for failing to present an alternative vision for the country, the opposition parties seemed to have found their mojo, in taking on Modi and his BJP through this issue. An overwhelming majority of Indians belong to marginalised castes. A 2021 Pew survey had found this to be at 69 percent of India’s total population. By championing their cause, the opposition alliance hopes to woo them, broaden its popular base and defeat the dominant BJP, which has won two comfortable majorities since 2014. Secondly, Modi has been trying to blur caste lines and, instead, consolidate support for a unified Hindu identity, as part of his party’s Hindutva agenda that has polarised Indians along religious and ethnic lines. The BJP has been criticised for its dog whistle politics against Muslims who form about 15 percent of India’s 1.4 billion people. The new caste-based movements threaten to derail these attempts, experts say. “The demand for a caste census can create a new caste consciousness among the various marginalised castes and can threaten the BJP’s Hindutva project,” said Zagade. “If caste becomes the central issue, it will push Hindutva away,” he added. In its dominance over the last decade, Modi’s BJP has sought to create a diverse voter base among Hindus, consisting of both dominant and marginalised castes, including tribals and Dalits. Modi, himself belonging to a “backward caste” community, has reiterated his caste identity in public meetings to draw in support. However, an opposition campaign to push for greater rights for India’s marginalised castes could see Modi’s support base cracking. “In the 2022 elections in Uttar Pradesh, Modi’s other backward caste (OBC) vote declined. Hence, the BJP will be worried that this new development could fracture its vote further,” said Sudha Pai, political scientist and author of a new book that studies the BJP’s grip over Dalit politics. Dalits, the former untouchables, lie at the bottom of the complex Hindu caste hierarchy. History might worry Modi and his aides, too. In the early 1990s, the BJP’s attempts to come to power through a communally-charged campaign to build a temple at the purported site of the birth of Hindu god Ram was undercut by the Mandal movement, which demanded greater opportunities and affirmative action for OBCs. The Mandal movement denied the BJP power for at least a decade. The opposition parties are hoping for an encore. As a result, while most other parties, including some of the BJP’s allies, have pushed for a national caste census, the BJP has remained shy of embracing this demand. Modi, on the day the findings of the census were revealed, the opposition parties of “committing the sin” of “dividing the country on caste lines”.      Most observers believe it is too early to tell how the issue will pan out, but either way, caste identities will be “one of the major poles” in the 2024 general elections when India elects a new government, said Pai.

Ireland is once again an outlier in the West, home to some of the loudest criticism of Israel and support of Palestinian rights, as the Middle East conflict rages. After Hamas launched an assault in Israel on October 7, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varakdar decried the deadly incursion, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 240 were taken captive. But less than a week later, he became one of the few European officials to raise alarm. “Israel doesn’t have the right to do wrong,” he said in something of a play on words as most European leaders were stressing Israel’s “right” to self-defence during its bombing campaign on Gaza, the enclave ruled by Hamas. In just 41 days of war, more than 11,400 Palestinians have been killed by Israel. Varadkar has also said Israel’s bombardment “amounts to collective punishment”, which is prohibited under the Geneva Conventions. Michael D Higgins, the 82-year-old Irish president whose role is largely ceremonial, said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was “notspeakingfor Ireland” when she expressed unconditional support for Israel on October 16 without acknowledging the ongoing occupation of Palestinian lands. After Israel began striking Gaza, Ireland, a member of the European Union, was one of the first countries to call for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire” to meet the “urgent” needs of civilians. Niamh Nichillin – a 50-year-old primary school teacher in Tipperary and a member of Fianna Fail, one of two governing centre-right parties – is among the many in Ireland who sympathise with the people of Gaza, one of the world’s most densely populated areas often described as an open-air prison due to Israel’s blockade of the enclave. “Israeli air strikes on Gaza are clearly disproportionate towards a civilian population with little or no defences,” she told News Agency. “This can hardly be called a war in the usual sense of the word.” Statements by Israeli officials indicate they are motivated by a “desire for the destruction of Gaza”, she said. “This is unacceptable.” On October 18, Ireland announced an additional 13 million-euro ($14m) package of humanitarian funding for Palestinians, lifting the 2023 total to 29 million euros ($31.5m) with the foreign ministry saying it was aware the unfolding situation in Gaza is a “humanitarian catastrophe of unprecedented magnitude”. “I would like the Irish people to continue to use their influence to ensure that there is a ceasefire, an end to the siege and that enough humanitarian aid is getting through,” said Nichillin, who welcomed the news of extra aid. In 1980, Ireland was the first EU country to call for the establishment of a Palestinian state. Thirteen years later, it became the last member of the bloc to open an Israeli embassy in Dublin. In 2018, Ireland drew worldwide attention when independent politician Frances Black proposed the Occupied Territories Bill, which would have banned and criminalised trading goods and services from lands occupied by Israel. Although it enjoyed support across the political spectrum and the public, it was removed from the government’s programme during coalition negotiations in 2020 between the two ruling parties, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael. In 2021, Ireland became the first EU country to declare that Israel was involved in the “de-facto annexation” of Palestinian land, upsetting Israel’s foreign ministry, which said the move “constitutes a victory for extremist Palestinian factions”. “Ireland’s own history of colonisation by the British has made many Irish people empathetic towards other nations under occupation or colonisation,” said Cathal O’hEanna, a representative of the left-wing nationalist party Sinn Fein. “Our centuries-long struggle for the right to self-determination resonates with the Palestinian struggle for statehood and independence,” he told News Agency. John Lyndon, executive director of the Alliance for Middle East Peace, said, “At first there was Irish solidarity with Jews in Mandate Palestine and then early Israel because they were seen as fighting British colonialism, using some of the same paramilitary tactics as the IRA. And some also had an affinity with the kibbutz movement and the socialist ideals of early Israel.” “However, after Israel started expanding settlements on Palestinian territory following the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, Irish allegiance switched towards the Palestinian cause,” he added. Today, as the war escalates, pro-Palestine protests continue throughout the country. On Wednesday evening, more than 1,000 people rallied outside the lower house in Dublin as a motion to expel Israeli Ambassador Dana Erlich, who has accused Higgins of “spreading misinformation” about the Israel-Hamas war, was being voted on. The motion – which was put forward by the Social Democrats and supported by Sinn Fein and the Trotskyist People before Profit party – was defeated. Another motion tabled by Sinn Fein calling on Ireland to refer Israel to the International Criminal Court was also defeated. Celebrated Irish writers are also organising. Authors including Sally Rooney, Sinead Gleeson, Donal Ryan and Colin Barrett are participating in four Irish Writers for Palestine events from November 28. “Writers, especially in Ireland, occupy a certain cultural position, and we hope to use that position to do what we can to show our solidarity,” said Michael Magee, one of the organisers. “Voices sympathetic to the Palestinian struggle, both within Israel and across Europe and the US, are facing more marginalisation and violent suppression than ever.” Lyndon said that although he understands his fellow citizens, he feels that it is “important to be careful” about how solidarity with the Palestinian cause is expressed. “The [October 7 attacks] triggered memories of the Holocaust for the Israeli side while the Palestinians now feel that they are reliving the Nakba. I’d like to see more solidarity with Palestinians and Israelis working together to end the occupation and ensure self-determination for each rather than one side fighting the other.” Lyndon tragically lost a friend, the longtime advocate for Palestinian rightsVivian Silver, in the Hamas attacks. My friend Vivian Silver, who helped make ALLMEP a reality & founded members@AJEECNISPED&@WomenWagePeaceis dead, murdered by Hamas.This is pic of Vivian with me & ALLMEP board, 5yrs ago last week. Overlooking a Gaza she wanted to be free, & at peace. Rest in power, Vivian 💔pic.twitter.com/Qv1IkYX0dT — John Lyndon (@JohnLyndon_)November 13, 2023  Ireland should position itself as a peace negotiator, he said, because it has its “own history with conflict resolution” through its efforts to bring about the Good Friday Agreement. That Ireland “does not have the same ‘colonial baggage’ as other EU countries” would reassure Palestinians if the country were present in any negotiations. “Ireland’s relationship with the US is also very good, so I would like to see Ireland use those strengths to play a better diplomatic role [in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict],” said Lyndon. While Irish citizens of the Republic of Ireland overwhelmingly support the Palestinian cause, the picture is different in Northern Ireland, where people endured 30 years of violence known as the Troubles between nationalists and unionists. That conflict largely came to an end with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. Opinions on the Middle East are divided along sectarian lines to a degree with Palestinian flags a common feature in the nationalist neighbourhoods of Belfast and Israeli flags in the unionist areas. While these flags have long flown, more have appeared since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Amr Hashad, an activist in Belfast, said he sees similarities between the nationalist struggle in Northern Ireland for independence from the UK, which led to the emergence of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (Provos) in 1969 following widespread violence against the Catholic community, and Hamas, which was founded in 1987 at the start of the first Palestinian intifada, or uprising. However, after the Provos launched an attack in London in 1995, “the British government and the EU negotiated with this army and even asked US President Bill Clinton for help in doing so until they managed to find a solution to the conflict”, Hashad said. “Today, we find ourselves in a similar situation to the Provos’ secret attack on London where Hamas attacked Israel and the entire Gaza Strip is being punished mercilessly as innocent women, children and the elderly are killed with the support of the West. The question I ask myself is: Why aren’t the West negotiating with Hamas like it did with the Provos?” Soon after the October 7 attacks, Sinn Fein, in contrast with statements made by other Western governments and political parties, said that while it had “no plans to meet or engage” with Hamas, it would “not rule out meeting with or talking to anybody” as part of efforts to secure peace in the Middle East. Ireland is not among the small minority of EU countries that officially recognises Palestine and, in line with the bloc’s position, considers Hamas a terrorist organisation. The Irish parliament put forward a motion in 2014, calling on the government to formally recognise its statehood, but the push remains in limbo. Michael Martin, foreign minister, said in September that the government was preparing to recognise Palestine as an independent state. Andrew Cottey, a professor at the University College Cork’s department of government and politics, said that despite the political and public support of Palestine, “whatever the rights or wrongs of recognising Palestine, it would put Ireland in a minority within the European Union” and “significantly at odds with the United States on this issue”. “You can make an argument for recognising Palestine, but were Ireland to do that, would it have any substantive impact on the situation on the ground in Israel and Palestine? Probably not. And the kind of political cost for the Irish government would be to antagonise the United States and isolate itself within the European Union.” Stephanie Nic Carthaig, a translator who believes Ireland should officially recognise Palestine, said she understands Cottey’s argument, but added: “Neoliberalism in Irish politics, servile attitudes to empire and influence from the US are behind this slowness to recognise Palestine.” Irish composer Raymond Deane, co-founder of the Ireland-Palestine Solidarity Campaign, criticised his country’s position on numerous fronts. “Ireland should disassociate itself from EU policy [on Israel and Palestine] from dealing exclusively with the Palestinian Authority, which has no real authority, and cease to repeat the ‘two-state solution’ ad nauseam,” he told News Agency. He would also like to see Ireland put an arms embargo on Israel and witness the Occupied Territories Bill implemented. While the Irish government has gone further in its condemnation of Israel than other EU countries, Nichillin, Deane and Nic Carthaig are not alone in wanting the Irish government to do more. Mary Lou McDonald, president of Sinn Fein, has said recognising Palestinian statehood would top the foreign policy agenda should her party lead the government. Sinn Fein met with ambassadors from Arab countries this month to discuss Gaza and the need for “dialogue” to secure a just and lasting peace, including a “viable state of Palestine”.

Ireland is once again an outlier in the West, home to some of the loudest criticism of Israel and support of Palestinian rights, as the Middle East conflict rages. After Hamas launched an assault in Israel on October 7, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varakdar decried the deadly incursion, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 240 were taken captive. But less than a week later, he became one of the few European officials to raise alarm. “Israel doesn’t have the right to do wrong,” he said in something of a play on words as most European leaders were stressing Israel’s “right” to self-defence during its bombing campaign on Gaza, the enclave ruled by Hamas. In just 41 days of war, more than 11,400 Palestinians have been killed by Israel. Varadkar has also said Israel’s bombardment “amounts to collective punishment”, which is prohibited under the Geneva Conventions. Michael D Higgins, the 82-year-old Irish president whose role is largely ceremonial, said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was “notspeakingfor Ireland” when she expressed unconditional support for Israel on October 16 without acknowledging the ongoing occupation of Palestinian lands. After Israel began striking Gaza, Ireland, a member of the European Union, was one of the first countries to call for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire” to meet the “urgent” needs of civilians. Niamh Nichillin – a 50-year-old primary school teacher in Tipperary and a member of Fianna Fail, one of two governing centre-right parties – is among the many in Ireland who sympathise with the people of Gaza, one of the world’s most densely populated areas often described as an open-air prison due to Israel’s blockade of the enclave. “Israeli air strikes on Gaza are clearly disproportionate towards a civilian population with little or no defences,” she told News Agency. “This can hardly be called a war in the usual sense of the word.” Statements by Israeli officials indicate they are motivated by a “desire for the destruction of Gaza”, she said. “This is unacceptable.” On October 18, Ireland announced an additional 13 million-euro ($14m) package of humanitarian funding for Palestinians, lifting the 2023 total to 29 million euros ($31.5m) with the foreign ministry saying it was aware the unfolding situation in Gaza is a “humanitarian catastrophe of unprecedented magnitude”. “I would like the Irish people to continue to use their influence to ensure that there is a ceasefire, an end to the siege and that enough humanitarian aid is getting through,” said Nichillin, who welcomed the news of extra aid. In 1980, Ireland was the first EU country to call for the establishment of a Palestinian state. Thirteen years later, it became the last member of the bloc to open an Israeli embassy in Dublin. In 2018, Ireland drew worldwide attention when independent politician Frances Black proposed the Occupied Territories Bill, which would have banned and criminalised trading goods and services from lands occupied by Israel. Although it enjoyed support across the political spectrum and the public, it was removed from the government’s programme during coalition negotiations in 2020 between the two ruling parties, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael. In 2021, Ireland became the first EU country to declare that Israel was involved in the “de-facto annexation” of Palestinian land, upsetting Israel’s foreign ministry, which said the move “constitutes a victory for extremist Palestinian factions”. “Ireland’s own history of colonisation by the British has made many Irish people empathetic towards other nations under occupation or colonisation,” said Cathal O’hEanna, a representative of the left-wing nationalist party Sinn Fein. “Our centuries-long struggle for the right to self-determination resonates with the Palestinian struggle for statehood and independence,” he told News Agency. John Lyndon, executive director of the Alliance for Middle East Peace, said, “At first there was Irish solidarity with Jews in Mandate Palestine and then early Israel because they were seen as fighting British colonialism, using some of the same paramilitary tactics as the IRA. And some also had an affinity with the kibbutz movement and the socialist ideals of early Israel.” “However, after Israel started expanding settlements on Palestinian territory following the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, Irish allegiance switched towards the Palestinian cause,” he added. Today, as the war escalates, pro-Palestine protests continue throughout the country. On Wednesday evening, more than 1,000 people rallied outside the lower house in Dublin as a motion to expel Israeli Ambassador Dana Erlich, who has accused Higgins of “spreading misinformation” about the Israel-Hamas war, was being voted on. The motion – which was put forward by the Social Democrats and supported by Sinn Fein and the Trotskyist People before Profit party – was defeated. Another motion tabled by Sinn Fein calling on Ireland to refer Israel to the International Criminal Court was also defeated. Celebrated Irish writers are also organising. Authors including Sally Rooney, Sinead Gleeson, Donal Ryan and Colin Barrett are participating in four Irish Writers for Palestine events from November 28. “Writers, especially in Ireland, occupy a certain cultural position, and we hope to use that position to do what we can to show our solidarity,” said Michael Magee, one of the organisers. “Voices sympathetic to the Palestinian struggle, both within Israel and across Europe and the US, are facing more marginalisation and violent suppression than ever.” Lyndon said that although he understands his fellow citizens, he feels that it is “important to be careful” about how solidarity with the Palestinian cause is expressed. “The [October 7 attacks] triggered memories of the Holocaust for the Israeli side while the Palestinians now feel that they are reliving the Nakba. I’d like to see more solidarity with Palestinians and Israelis working together to end the occupation and ensure self-determination for each rather than one side fighting the other.” Lyndon tragically lost a friend, the longtime advocate for Palestinian rightsVivian Silver, in the Hamas attacks. My friend Vivian Silver, who helped make ALLMEP a reality & founded members@AJEECNISPED&@WomenWagePeaceis dead, murdered by Hamas.This is pic of Vivian with me & ALLMEP board, 5yrs ago last week.

Rest in power, Vivian 💔pic.twitter.com/Qv1IkYX0dT — John Lyndon (@JohnLyndon_)November 13, 2023  Ireland should position itself as a peace negotiator, he said, because it has its “own history with conflict resolution” through its efforts to bring about the Good Friday Agreement. That Ireland “does not have the same ‘colonial baggage’ as other EU countries” would reassure Palestinians if the country were present in any negotiations. “Ireland’s relationship with the US is also very good, so I would like to see Ireland use those strengths to play a better diplomatic role [in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict],” said Lyndon. While Irish citizens of the Republic of Ireland overwhelmingly support the Palestinian cause, the picture is different in Northern Ireland, where people endured 30 years of violence known as the Troubles between nationalists and unionists. That conflict largely came to an end with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. Opinions on the Middle East are divided along sectarian lines to a degree with Palestinian flags a common feature in the nationalist neighbourhoods of Belfast and Israeli flags in the unionist areas. While these flags have long flown, more have appeared since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Amr Hashad, an activist in Belfast, said he sees similarities between the nationalist struggle in Northern Ireland for independence from the UK, which led to the emergence of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (Provos) in 1969 following widespread violence against the Catholic community, and Hamas, which was founded in 1987 at the start of the first Palestinian intifada, or uprising.

Theybroadcast themselvespreparing to sign the documents, allegedlyprovided bya Trump campaign attorney, claiming that they were the legitimate representatives of the state’s electoral votes. By that time, Trump’s loss in the state – by less than 11,000 votes – had already been certified by the state’s Republican governor affirming that Joe Biden won Arizona in the 2020 presidential election. But in the weeks that followed, five of Arizona’s 11 “Republican electors,” as they called themselves, pushed an unusually vocal campaign, compared to other fake electors from states across the country, for Vice President Mike Pence to reject the legitimate Democratic slate of electors. Instead, they called on Pence to accept them or no electors at all, according to a News Agency KFile review of their interviews, actions and comments on social media. Before he became a politician, House Speaker Mike Johnson partnered with an anti-gay conversion therapy group Tom Emmer cast doubt on the 2020 election and supported lawsuit to throw election to Trump Much attention has been drawn to the fake elector schemes inGeorgiaandMichiganwhere local and state authorities charged some participants for election crimes this past summer. But in no other state were there fake electors more active in publicly promoting the scheme than in Arizona. Now those fake electors find themselves under new legal scrutiny as the Arizona attorney general announced a broad investigation into their actions and their public campaign that could open the electors up to increased legal liability, according to experts who spoke with News Agency. “They were more brazen,” Anthony Michael Kreis, an expert on constitutional law at Georgia State University told News Agency. “There is no difficulty trying to piece together their unlawful, corrupt intent because they publicly documented their stream of consciousness bread trail for prosecutors to follow.” Attorney General Kris Mayes, in an interview with News Agency, said she has been in contact with investigators in Michigan and Georgia and the Department of Justice. “It’s robust. It’s a serious matter,” Mayes, a Democrat, said of her ongoing investigation. “We’re going to make sure that we do it on our timetable, applying the resources that it requires to make sure that justice is done, for not only Arizonans, but for the entire country.” All11 electorstookpartinmultiplefailed legal challenges, firstasking ajudge to invalidate the state’s results in a conspiracy theory-laden court case and then taking part in a last-ditch, desperate plea seeking to force Pence to help throw the election to Trump. The cases weredismissed. Of the 11 fake electors in Arizona, five were the most publicly vocal members advocating the scheme in the state: Kelli Ward, the chairperson of the state party and her spouse, Michael Ward; state Rep. Anthony Kern, then a sitting lawmaker; Jake Hoffman, a newly elected member of the Arizona House; and Tyler Bowyer, a top state official with the Republican National Committee. Each of these five publicly pushed for the legitimate electors to be discarded by Pence on January 6, 2021. One of the fake electors, Kern, took part in “Stop the Steal” rallies and was photographed in a restricted area on the Capitol steps during the riot at the Capitol. “The Arizona false electors left a trail here that will surely interest prosecutors,” Ryan Goodman, a law professor at New York University who previously served as the special counsel to the general counsel at the Department of Defense, told News Agency. Electors, a part of the Electoral College system, represent the popular vote in each state. When a candidate wins a state, the party’s designated slate of electors gets to participate in the Electoral College process. The electors meet in a ceremonial process and sign certificates, officially casting their vote for president. News Agency reached out to all of the electors, but only received comment from two of them. The most publicly vocal of the fake electors, Kelli Ward calledthe groupthe “true electors,” and provided play-by-play updates on the Arizona Republican Party’s YouTube. Falsely saying the state’s electoral votes were “contested,” even though legal challenges to the count had been dismissed, she urged supporters to call on Arizona’s state legislature to decertify the state’s results. “We believe our votes are the ones that will count on January 6th,”she saidin one interview on conservative talk radio, two days after signing the fake documents. Ward’s comments were echoedin tweetsby her husband, Michael, also an elector and a gadfly in Arizona politicsknown forspreading conspiracy theories. In a post sharing a White House memo that urged Pence to reject the results from states that submitted fake electors, Michael Ward hinted at retribution for Republicans who failed to act. “My Holiday prayer is that every backstabbing ‘Republican’ gets paid back for their failure to act come Jan 20th!” hewrote in a tweeton December 22. Another prominent elector was the RNC Committeeman Bowyer, who on his Twitter account pushed false election claims and conspiracies. “It will be up to the President of the Senate and congress to decide,” Bowyertweetedafter signing the fake electors documents. In repeated comments Bowyer declared the decision would come down to Pence. “It’s pretty simple: The President of the United States Senate (VP) has the awesome power of acknowledging a specific envelope of electoral votes when there are two competing slates— or none at all,” wrote Bowyer in aDecember 28 tweet. “We don’t live in a Democracy. The presidential election isn’t democratic,”he addedwhen receiving pushback. A spokesperson for Bowyer said that he was simply responding to a question from a user on what next steps looked like and maintained that there was precedent for a competing slate of electors. Bowyer urged action in the lead up to the joint session of Congress on January 6. “Be a modern Son of Liberty today,” hesaidlate inthe morningof January 6 – a posthe deletedfollowing the riot at the Capitol. The spokesperson for Bowyer said he had not directly been contacted by Mayes’s office or the DOJ. Newly elected state representative Hoffman sent atwo-page letterto Pence on January 5, 2021, asking the vice president to order that Arizona’s electors not be decided by the popular vote of the citizens, but instead by the members of the state legislature. “It is in this late hour, with urgency, that I respectfully ask that you delay the certification of election results for Arizona during the joint session of Congress on January 6, 2021, and seek clarification from the Arizona state legislature as to which slate of electors are proper and accurate,”wrote Hoffman. Ininterviews,Hoffman repeatedly argued no electors be sent at all because “we don’t have certainty in the outcome of our election,” and to contest Democrat electors if they were sent. Then-state Rep. Kern, who lost his seat in the 2020 election, spent his final weeks in officesharing“stop the steal” content andparticipatingin their rallies. He said he was “honored” to be a Trump elector. “On January 6th, vice President Mike Pence gets a choice on which electors he’s going to choose,” Kern told the Epoch Timesin an interviewin December. “There is no president elect until January 6th,” he added. Kern hadn’t changed his tune in an interview with News Agency. “Why, why would you think alternate electors are a lie?,” Kern said. Kernrepeatedly promotedthe January 6, 2021, rally preceding the Capitol riot. Kern was in DC that day and shared a photo from the Capitol grounds as rioters gathered on the steps of the Capitol. “In DC supporting@realDonaldTrumpand@News Agency@FoxNews@MSNBCare spewing lies again. #truth,” he wrote in atweet. Later Kernwas seenin a restricted area of the Capitol steps during the riot. There is no indication he was violent, and he has not been charged with any crime.

Kern hadn’t changed his tune in an interview with News Agency. “Why, why would you think alternate electors are a lie?,” Kern said. Kernrepeatedly promotedthe January 6, 2021, rally preceding the Capitol riot. Kern was in DC that day and shared a photo from the Capitol grounds as rioters gathered on the steps of the Capitol. “In DC supporting@realDonaldTrumpand@News Agency@FoxNews@MSNBCare spewing lies again. #truth,” he wrote in atweet. Later Kernwas seenin a restricted area of the Capitol steps during the riot. There is no indication he was violent, and he has not been charged with any crime.

Serbia will hold a snap election next month after President Aleksandar Vucic dissolved parliament in the face of political pressure at home and from the European Union. The parliamentary vote and parallel local elections will be held on December 17, less than two years after the victory of the Serbian Progressive Party at the polls. “We live in times that are difficult for the whole world, in times of global challenges, wars and conflicts when it is necessary that we are all united in preserving vital national and state interests of the Republic of Serbia,” Vucic said during an announcement on live television on Wednesday. Vucic, who is in his second term as president, faces growing criticism from the political opposition and the greater public overback-to-back shootingsin May that killed 18 people. The president and his party, which has led Serbia since 2012, have been accused by protesters of promoting a culture of violence while cracking down on media and electoral freedom. At the time of the protests, several pro-EU parties said the government had ignored protesters’ demands and called for new elections. “Serbia is in a deep political and social crisis,” they said. “The demands of those who have been protesting for months were ignored. We need responsible people in politics who will solve problems instead of ignoring them.” Vucic denies the accusations but will have to convince voters that he is serious about change. Also in need of convincing is Brussels as Serbia makes a play for EU membership. To secure entry into the 27-member bloc, it must follow the EU’s rules, which include sanctioning Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, tackling organised crime and corruption, and strengthening the rule of law and human rights. While challenging, the EU’s most important precondition is that Serbia normalises itsrelationship with Kosovo, a self-proclaimed independent state since 2008 that Belgrade still regards as part of its territory. More than 100 countries recognise Kosovo as a country, but it has not yet achieved member status at the United Nations. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said on Tuesday during a visit to Belgrade that Serbia and Kosovo must make more progress if they want EU membership. Some observers believe Vucic has called for elections to delay tackling this politically sensitive problem. Much of Kosovo is ethnic Albanian, although its northern half is home to ethnic Serbians who reject the government in Pristina. The conflict between the two ethnic groups was a catalyst for violence and fighting in the late 1990s, and NATO peacekeeping troops have been stationed in Kosovo ever since.

The cable underscores profound concern among American officials about the growing anger against the United States that erupted soon after Israel launched its operations against Hamas, following the militant group’s attacks in Israel on October 7 that left over 1,400 Israelis dead. “We are losing badly on the messaging battlespace,” reads a Wednesday cable from the US Embassy in Oman, citing conversations with “a wide range of trusted and sober-minded contacts.” The robust US support for Israel’s actions is being seen, the cable warns, “as material and moral culpability in what they consider to be possible war crimes.” The cable from the embassy was written by the second-highest US official in Muscat and sent to, among others, the White House’s National Security Council, the CIA and the FBI. While it’s just one cable from a regional embassy, it provides a private snapshot of the alarm over the growing anti-US wave sweeping the Middle East. Another cable obtained by News Agency from the American embassy in Cairo relayed back to Washington, as part of a daily media summary, the commentary in a state-run Egyptian newspaper that “President Biden’s cruelty and disregard for Palestinians exceeded all previous US presidents.” News Agency has reached out to the State Department for comment. President Joe Biden has been under growing pressure domestically and abroad over US support of Israel amid images of destruction in Gaza and the dire humanitarian crisis in the region. While the administration has resisted calls for a ceasefire, officials have worked to ramp up aid going into Gaza and pushed for humanitarian pauses to allow more assistance to flow into the enclave and to allow civilians to flee away from the fighting. Inrecent days, US allies in the Arab world have made clear their deep anger at the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Last weekend, Secretary of State Antony Blinken attended a summit convened by the Jordanian foreign minister that was attended by the top diplomats from Egypt, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia, as well as the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization. At the summit, the Arab leaders called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza while Blinken reiterated US opposition, arguing that it would give Hamas time to regroup and launch another attack on Israel. The White House said Thursday thatIsrael had agreed to moveforward with daily four-hourpauses of military operationsin areas of Northern Gaza. Blinken had an agreement in principle on the pauses after his meetings in Israel last week, even though Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came out against the idea of humanitarian pauses on Friday, US officials told News Agency. That was seen as the Israeli prime minister playing to his coalition, and the officials noted it was similar to when the Israeli government opposed humanitarian aid getting into Gaza before deciding to allow it. Although Israel had already been instituting such pauses, American officials see this agreement as progress because the Israelis are using the language of “pauses,” which is something the US believes it can build on. Still, within the administration, concerns have grown over US support for Israel. News Agency previously reportedthat some senior officials privately say there are aspects of Israel’s military operationsthey simply cannot stomach defending;calls for the US to back a ceasefire are growing among government employees; and others are distraught by the incessant images of Palestinian civilians being killed by Israeli airstrikes. Biden has also been confronted by the frustration growing domestically. The president was confronted by aprotester calling for a ceasefireat a private fundraiser last week; pro-Palestinian protests have been a daily occurrence near the White House compound; and this week, one of the entrances near the West Wing was covered in bright-red handprints – meant to mimic blood – and words like “genocide Joe.”",,CNN,21967.0,663

Another cable obtained by News Agency from the American embassy in Cairo relayed back to Washington, as part of a daily media summary, the commentary in a state-run Egyptian newspaper that “President Biden’s cruelty and disregard for Palestinians exceeded all previous US presidents.” News Agency has reached out to the State Department for comment. President Joe Biden has been under growing pressure domestically and abroad over US support of Israel amid images of destruction in Gaza and the dire humanitarian crisis in the region. While the administration has resisted calls for a ceasefire, officials have worked to ramp up aid going into Gaza and pushed for humanitarian pauses to allow more assistance to flow into the enclave and to allow civilians to flee away from the fighting. Inrecent days, US allies in the Arab world have made clear their deep anger at the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Last weekend, Secretary of State Antony Blinken attended a summit convened by the Jordanian foreign minister that was attended by the top diplomats from Egypt, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia, as well as the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization. At the summit, the Arab leaders called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza while Blinken reiterated US opposition, arguing that it would give Hamas time to regroup and launch another attack on Israel. The White House said Thursday thatIsrael had agreed to moveforward with daily four-hourpauses of military operationsin areas of Northern Gaza. Blinken had an agreement in principle on the pauses after his meetings in Israel last week, even though Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came out against the idea of humanitarian pauses on Friday, US officials told News Agency. That was seen as the Israeli prime minister playing to his coalition, and the officials noted it was similar to when the Israeli government opposed humanitarian aid getting into Gaza before deciding to allow it. Although Israel had already been instituting such pauses, American officials see this agreement as progress because the Israelis are using the language of “pauses,” which is something the US believes it can build on. Still, within the administration, concerns have grown over US support for Israel. News Agency previously reportedthat some senior officials privately say there are aspects of Israel’s military operationsthey simply cannot stomach defending;calls for the US to back a ceasefire are growing among government employees; and others are distraught by the incessant images of Palestinian civilians being killed by Israeli airstrikes. Biden has also been confronted by the frustration growing domestically. The president was confronted by aprotester calling for a ceasefireat a private fundraiser last week; pro-Palestinian protests have been a daily occurrence near the White House compound; and this week, one of the entrances near the West Wing was covered in bright-red handprints – meant to mimic blood – and words like “genocide Joe.”",,CNN,21967.0,663

But even as the first family keeps the celebrations muted and out-of-sight, the moment nevertheless highlights his greatest campaign liability – his advanced age and, along with it, perceptions among voters that his physical and mental fitness have declined. On Monday morning, as he presided over the annual Thanksgiving turkey pardon, Biden seemingly confused pop stars Britney Spears and Taylor Swift. Being the national Thanksgiving turkey, he said, is “harder than getting a ticket to the Renaissance tour or Britney’s tour she on -– it’s kind of warm in Brazil right now,” appearing to confuse Spears with Swift, who is currently on the South America leg of her Eras tour. He also offered multiple jokes about his age. “I just want you to know it’s difficult turning 60 – difficult,” he told the turkey pardon audience, laughing. And as he noted the 76th anniversary of the event, he joked that he “wasn’t there” at the first edition. Later, a pictureon Biden’s Instagramfeed showed him posing with a birthday cake ablaze with candles. “Turns out on your 146th birthday, you run out of space for candles!” the president said in the post. Officials at the White House and the campaign privately acknowledge age is a vulnerability, and they work both to eliminate potential gaffes and project vigor. Biden was prescribed custom orthotics to help with his feet this year, after his annual physicaldeterminedthat he experiences a “stiff gait.” In recent months, when Biden flies on Air Force One, he has started using a smaller, shorter set of stairs more frequently to board and deplane. Joe Biden is facing a near-historic deficit for an incumbent Biden has also made an effort to pass reporters on bike rides during vacations in Delaware, occasionally stopping to take questions while clad in his helmet. (The president is an avid user of Peloton at the White House.) Still, the age liability comes into sharper focus almost by the day. A spate of recent polling, including anew News Agency poll, indicates it’s a chronic issue with voters. And critics raise it every chance they get. On Saturday, former President Donald Trump, the front-runner for the GOP nomination, called Biden “a stupid person” who “can’t get off this stage … by the time whatever it is he’s taking wears off,” prompting cheers from a crowd in Fort Dodge, Iowa. On Sunday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, 45, remarked that “Father Time is undefeated,” naming age as an issue for both Biden and Trump, 77, in aninterview with News Agency’s Jake Tapper. Biden already is the oldest president in history, ahead of Ronald Reagan, who was 77 at the end of his second term. If elected in 2024, Biden would be 86 at the end of his second term. Trump, who would be approaching 83 at the same point, would take the baton for oldest president in history if elected. Biden advisers argue – and grumble – that there’s a double standard, with media coverage more focused on Biden’s age than Trump’s. Still, they insist that voters are focused on other issues and that age won’t be a deciding factor next November. “I don’t think the campaign should be focused on anything but the winning record,” said Democratic Rep. Robert Garcia of California, a member of the Biden campaign’s national advisory board. “Everything else about people’s biographies or when their birthdays are – that doesn’t matter. People want to know, what did they do, and what are they going to do?” On Monday, Biden’s birthday milestone will pass with little fanfare. His day is set to include the time-honored pre-Thanksgiving tradition of the annual turkey pardon. He is also expected to receive briefings from his national security advisers on global crises. The campaign isn’t ignoring Biden’s birthday, aides told News Agency. A Democratic National Committee official tells News Agency there are plans to commemorate the occasion with a post to social media, as the party has done every year since 2011, except in the three years when he was a candidate or prospective candidate. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is also urging supporters to sign a virtual birthday card for the president. The former president, who has openly criticized Biden on just about everything, has shown unusual restraint when it comes to directly attacking the president’s age. It’s a topic of sensitivity for both men, and Trump seems aware of the perils of contrasting himself with Biden over their exact age difference – which is three years and five months. In a recent interview, Trump avoided attacking Biden’s age directly. “He’s not too old, he’s incompetent,” Trump told Megyn Kelly in an interview on her eponymous Sirius XM show last month. “Age is interesting because some people are very sharp and some people do lose it, but you lose it at 40 and 50 also,” he went on. “But no, he’s not too old at all. He’s grossly incompetent.” DeSantis argues Trump and Biden are too old for presidency In turn, the Biden campaign has begun to signal it’s not afraid to go there, too. “Is Donald Trump okay?” an official Biden campaign account said in apostto social media platform X earlier this month. It featured a mash-up video of Trump gaffes, including confusing the city he was in, calling former President Barack Obama his “leading political opponent” and mixing up the home country of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. For his own part, Biden sometimes laughs off his age. “I don’t look it, but I’m 180 years old. I’ve been around a long time,” he joked to donors at a recent fundraiser. But mostly, he and other officials frame his age as a source of wisdom and experience. “I have more experience than any president has in the history of the United States,” he said at another fundraiser. “One of the things that comes with age, hopefully, is wisdom.” John Kirby, the National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications,  suggested that Biden’s experience – particularly in the foreign policy realm – is a positive. “I’ve never seen the world more turbulent, and at a time like this, when things are as turbulent and uncertain and in some cases – frightening – as they are right now, you want somebody at the helm who has seen the world, who has developed the relationships with world leaders, who has experienced problems akin to these over and over and over again, and who understands the history behind where we are today,” Kirby told News Agency. Biden “brings to the foreign policy helm a steady hand and wisdom and experience,” Kirby said. “That is irreplaceable.” White House aides also point to the president’s capacity to participate in strenuous trips and high-stakes meetings with world leaders as evidence of his stamina. He often leaves his colleagues exhausted, they say. Kirby pointed to instances of Biden pressing his colleagues to add events or engagements to jam-packed schedules. He added a call with the Emir of Qatar Friday morning ahead of meetings at the APEC summit in California. He also added an impromptu gaggle with reporters on Air Force One following a grueling trip to Tel Aviv, Israel, last month. Polls show the question persists. In an AugustAP-NORC Poll, 77% of respondents agreed with the assessment that Biden is too old to effectively serve another four-year term as president, while 51% of respondents said the same of Trump. In a national News Agencypollconducted by SSRS earlier this month, just 25% of registered voters say Biden has the stamina and sharpness to serve effectively as president, while 53% feel Trump does. And in the newer News Agency poll, conducted by the University of New Hampshire, 56% of likely Democratic voters in the Granite State mentioned the president’s age when asked to name their biggest concern about Biden as a candidate. Biden faces a warning sign from younger voters critical to his coalition When New Hampshire adults more broadly were polled on a list of the candidates’ personal attributes, Trump fared worse on each (temperament, honesty and integrity, policy positions, decision-making abilities) than Biden – except physical and mental fitness. A majority of voters – 58% – offered a poor assessment of Biden’s physical and mental fitness, compared with 53% who gave Trump poor marks. Still, those numbers reflect clear concerns from voters on the issue for both candidates. There is, of course, the possibility that Biden could square off with a different opponent in the general election. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who is in second place in the New Hampshire GOP primary poll, has proposed “mandatory mental competency tests for politicians over 75 years old.” The president’s age is often one of the first topics to come up inconversations with young voters– often as a subject of questions about whether he’s up to the job. “I don’t want to say it’s his age alone that could be a deterrent for young voters,” said Kerry Singleton, a senior at Morehouse College in Atlanta. “I will say it’s the delivery on the promises that were given to a lot of the young voters.” Rachael Carroll, who graduated last year from Clark Atlanta University, said she believes Biden is from another era, where he doesn’t understand the progressive views of many Democratic voters. “No offense, but yes, it’s a little old to me,” Carroll said, adding that Trump’s age should be of equal concern to Americans. “They don’t understand what we’re going through now because we’re living in two completely different times.” Nabilah Islam Parkes, who last fall became the youngest woman elected to the Georgia state Senate, said she doesn’t believe age is the overriding concern about Biden. She said questions about the administration’s handling of the Middle East – and his worldview – are far more pressing. “As long as we feel like he reflects our values,” she said, “age shouldn’t be an issue.” And progressive groups working to mobilize young voters said that they do not think Biden’s age will ultimately be a significant factor in whether young voters show up for him at the polls. “It’s so low on the list of things we think about it and things that are actually impacting our lives,” said Jack Lobel, national press secretary for Voters of Tomorrow, an organization that focuses on Gen Z voters. “It’s not a primary concern.” News Agency’s Jeff Zeleny, Camila DeChalus, Kristen Holmes, and Arlette Saenz contributed to this report.",,CNN,42473.0,1755

But even as the first family keeps the celebrations muted and out-of-sight, the moment nevertheless highlights his greatest campaign liability – his advanced age and, along with it, perceptions among voters that his physical and mental fitness have declined. On Monday morning, as he presided over the annual Thanksgiving turkey pardon, Biden seemingly confused pop stars Britney Spears and Taylor Swift. Being the national Thanksgiving turkey, he said, is “harder than getting a ticket to the Renaissance tour or Britney’s tour she on -– it’s kind of warm in Brazil right now,” appearing to confuse Spears with Swift, who is currently on the South America leg of her Eras tour. He also offered multiple jokes about his age. “I just want you to know it’s difficult turning 60 – difficult,” he told the turkey pardon audience, laughing. And as he noted the 76th anniversary of the event, he joked that he “wasn’t there” at the first edition. Later, a pictureon Biden’s Instagramfeed showed him posing with a birthday cake ablaze with candles. “Turns out on your 146th birthday, you run out of space for candles!” the president said in the post.

Biden faces a warning sign from younger voters critical to his coalition When New Hampshire adults more broadly were polled on a list of the candidates’ personal attributes, Trump fared worse on each (temperament, honesty and integrity, policy positions, decision-making abilities) than Biden – except physical and mental fitness. A majority of voters – 58% – offered a poor assessment of Biden’s physical and mental fitness, compared with 53% who gave Trump poor marks. Still, those numbers reflect clear concerns from voters on the issue for both candidates. There is, of course, the possibility that Biden could square off with a different opponent in the general election. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who is in second place in the New Hampshire GOP primary poll, has proposed “mandatory mental competency tests for politicians over 75 years old.” The president’s age is often one of the first topics to come up inconversations with young voters– often as a subject of questions about whether he’s up to the job. “I don’t want to say it’s his age alone that could be a deterrent for young voters,” said Kerry Singleton, a senior at Morehouse College in Atlanta. “I will say it’s the delivery on the promises that were given to a lot of the young voters.” Rachael Carroll, who graduated last year from Clark Atlanta University, said she believes Biden is from another era, where he doesn’t understand the progressive views of many Democratic voters. “No offense, but yes, it’s a little old to me,” Carroll said, adding that Trump’s age should be of equal concern to Americans. “They don’t understand what we’re going through now because we’re living in two completely different times.” Nabilah Islam Parkes, who last fall became the youngest woman elected to the Georgia state Senate, said she doesn’t believe age is the overriding concern about Biden. She said questions about the administration’s handling of the Middle East – and his worldview – are far more pressing. “As long as we feel like he reflects our values,” she said, “age shouldn’t be an issue.” And progressive groups working to mobilize young voters said that they do not think Biden’s age will ultimately be a significant factor in whether young voters show up for him at the polls. “It’s so low on the list of things we think about it and things that are actually impacting our lives,” said Jack Lobel, national press secretary for Voters of Tomorrow, an organization that focuses on Gen Z voters. “It’s not a primary concern.” News Agency’s Jeff Zeleny, Camila DeChalus, Kristen Holmes, and Arlette Saenz contributed to this report.",,CNN,42473.0,1755

Another state lawmaker, spurned by DeSantis earlier this year, is actively recruiting more of his colleagues to jump on the Trump bandwagon. Meanwhile, a cadre of former DeSantis political operatives who stopped working for the governor on poor terms are now entrenched in Trump world and motivated to embarrass their former boss. Welcome to the2024Revenge Tour. In the tug of war for home-state supremacy, Trump has gained the upper hand in part by exploiting rifts between DeSantis and Florida Republicans. The strategy has played out easier than the former president’s team anticipated, as DeSantis has left a wake of ill will in the state on the path to political stardom. As the 2024 campaign descends on Florida in the coming days, the ever-evolving relationship between the state’s Republicans and these two leading figures will be on full display. Trump, DeSantis and the rest of the GOP primary field addressed Florida Republicans at a state party event Saturday just outside Orlando. DeSantis had a midday time slot, sandwiched between Florida Sen. Rick Scott, his predecessor in Tallahassee who he doesn’t get along with, and state Rep. Randy Fine, the state’s only Jewish Republican lawmaker who recently asserted DeSantis hasn’t done enough to stop Nazis and antisemitism in Florida. Scott announced Thursday he was endorsing Trump, while Fine switched his allegiance to the former president last month. In his remarks Saturday, DeSantis said he was not concerned about Florida state lawmakers flipping their endorsement to Trump, telling the audience, “It’s a dynamic thing.” “No, look — this happens in these things. I mean, we’ve had flips the other way in other states,” DeSantis said, adding that “politicians do what they’re gonna do.” Christie, Hutchinson receive hostile reception at Florida Republican summit Trump closed out the gathering, touting the new endorsements from Florida lawmakers and bringing several of them onstage. The crowd laughed and cheered as Trump bashed DeSantis over his slip in national and state polls. The Sunshine State battle will continue Wednesday, when the Republican Party will hold its third presidential debate in Miami. Trump, who is skipping the debate once again, has scheduled counterprogramming just down the road in Hialeah. The next day, Trump will host Florida Republicans at Mar-a-Lago, a continuation of his courtship of party leaders and donors, while DeSantis will attend fundraisers in the state. At the same time, in a demonstration of DeSantis’ continued command over the GOP-controlled state Legislature, lawmakers are returning to Tallahassee next week at his urging to pass new sanctions against Iran following Hamas’ attack on Israel last month. They will also seek to address the state’s property insurance crisis, a concern that continues to generate negative headlines for DeSantis back home. The governor’s influence in the Sunshine State, once unquestioned, has repeatedly taken hits in recent months. His struggles as a presidential candidate have emboldened some Republicans here to break from DeSantis less than a year after he orchestrated the most dominant electoral victory in a Florida gubernatorial race in modern history. With the Iowa caucuses fast approaching, Trump’s lead in early nominating states and national polls appears sturdy while DeSantis has slipped into a distant second place alongside a surging Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor. His attempts to reassert himself as the state’s dominant political force have repeatedly run into enemies he has accumulated over the past decade. While DeSantis dismissed Fine as seeking “15 minutes of fame,” the governor’s allies are bracing for more state lawmakers to change their allegiance. One DeSantis adviser said they expect as many as six Republicans in the Legislature to flip sides, mostly freshmen lawmakers elected last year. State Sen. Joe Gruters, a former state party chair who DeSantis regularly iced out, is helping to lure more Republicans to Trump and said he expects to have a “pretty good group” to announce in the coming weeks. He conceded, though, that most lawmakers will remain behind DeSantis, which he attributed to the persuasive power of the governor’s line-item veto authority — a reality he experienced firsthand when DeSantis cut his projects out of the state budget earlier this year after Gruters endorsed Trump. Gruters recently secured another key win for Trump in the Sunshine State: overturning an attempt by DeSantis allies to force presidential candidates to sign a loyalty pledge to make Florida’s primary ballot. The overwhelming vote to scrap the proposal demonstrated Trump’s enduring popularity among Republican Party officials and served as a crushing defeat for DeSantis loyalists. “That was like throwing the hammer down,” Gruters said. “That reconfirmed that this is the president’s party.” State House Speaker Paul Renner said most Republican lawmakers are behind DeSantis because he has demonstrated he’s better positioned to carry GOP successes in Florida to the national stage. “Elections are about the future and not the past,” Renner said. “Those of us that live here and those of us that work closely with his team know this is a guy that delivers results.” DeSantis’ campaign insists the governor remains well positioned in his home state. Spokesman Andrew Romeo noted that DeSantis maintains the support of most elected officials “despite running against a de facto incumbent president.” “The governor will win his home state because Floridians want to see a fighter who will bring the same type of results-oriented leadership to Washington that he has provided in the Sunshine State,” Romeo said. Still, many of the Trump advisers and aides working hardest to keep DeSantis from the White House are people who used to call him their boss. Trump’s team is quick to point out that most of these individuals first worked for Trump and their return to him isn’t surprising. However, some harbor deep-seated and personal animosity toward DeSantis after acrimonious divorces — at times exceeding Trump’s own annoyance at his onetime ally for his supposedly “disloyal” decision to mount a competing presidential bid. The volume of ex-DeSantis staffers within Trump’s political operation has led some advisers to joke that the former president’s campaign should be called “the 2024 revenge tour.” Among them is Trump’s top campaign adviser, Susie Wiles, one of the state’s most successful political operatives in recent memory. She took over DeSantis’ campaign for governor in 2018 after early struggles and led him to a narrow victory, but she was pushed out of his inner circle the next year after a public falling out. DeSantis then successfully lobbied for her to be fired from Trump’s reelection team,News Agency previously reported, though she was eventually welcomed back and now sits atop his third White House bid. DeSantis also purged staffers seen as more loyal to Wiles. Justin Caporale, an experienced aide, and James Blair, a seasoned political consultant who became DeSantis’ deputy chief of staff, were pushed out of the governor’s office — both now work for Trump’s campaign. Jennifer Locetta, a former state party executive director who two sources say DeSantis ousted, recently joined the staff of a super PAC that supports Trump. Meanwhile, Trump’s Florida political operation is spearheaded by Brian Hughes, a longtime GOP strategist in the state who served as one of the architects of DeSantis’ successful first congressional run in 2012. After winning DeSantis declared he didn’t need a political adviser anymore to maintain his safe Republican seat, according to a person who previously worked for DeSantis. “He’s burned a lot of bridges,” the person said. “And then he puts fire on it so you can never rebuild it.” Many of these advisers and aides have intimate knowledge of what makes the governor tick, giving them a leg up in a race that until recently had been dominated by Trump and DeSantis. DeSantis’ frayed relationship with Florida’s consultant class has left him with fewer experienced campaign operatives than Trump in a state that is not only symbolically significant to both but is also a weighty mid-March delegate prize in the nominating fight. He recently split with another top adviser, campaign manager Generra Peck, who commanded his historic reelection last year. Marc Reichelderfer, a longtime Republican operative in the Sunshine State, is now overseeing preparations in Florida. Trump, though, is also known to burn through staff and advisers, and not all have remained loyal to him. A super PAC supporting DeSantis, Never Back Down, was founded by Ken Cuccinelli, a former official in Trump’s Department of Homeland Security. The organization’s communications team is led by Matt Wolking and Erin Perrine, two veterans of Trump’s reelection campaign. Florida Senate President Kathleen Passidomo, a close DeSantis ally, said she has found the governor to be collaborative and attentive. “I have had nothing but good dealings with the governor,” she said. “The things that I read in the press that people are saying about him, I never saw. A lot of the things I read are coming from people who want to get somewhere else in politics and not what’s in the best interest of our state.” In a statement to News Agency, Trump campaign spokesman Stephen Cheung said “any talk about personal grievances towards any primary candidate is misguided.” “Everybody on the campaign is focused on helping President Trump win the primary election – which he is dominating the competition by wide margins in every single poll – and defeating Crooked Joe Biden in the general,” Cheung said. The personal vendettas help explain the lengths that Trump and his allies have traveled to upstage the Florida governor. Last spring, while DeSantis sought to build support on Capitol Hill, Trump planned a dinner at his Mar-a-Lago resort with members of the Florida congressional delegation in a bid to court support on their shared home turf and embarrass the governor. In the 24 hours ahead of DeSantis’s visit to Washington, some of those representatives began announcing their support for Trump one by one, in a seemingly coordinated effort. Still, no one in Trump’s inner circle expected Rep. Greg Steube to share such detailed disdain about the governor when he announced his support for the former president, telling Politico that DeSantis has never reached out to him, even after an accident landed him in intensive care. Nor did they initially foresee Donalds, thought to be a close ally of the governor, backing Trump before DeSantis even entered the GOP presidential primary. Later, rubbing salt in the wound, the former president traveled to the Iowa State Fair with many of those House members – an entourage largely designed to troll DeSantis, who was making a simultaneous appearance. When DeSantis launched a national tour to promote a new book last spring, Caporale, a longtime Trump aide, privately discouraged Republican operatives from working for the Florida governor or face excommunication from Trump world. Caporale made it clear at the time that this extended to a potential Trump White House. A source said this is no longer in effect as DeSantis has slipped in the polls. Gruters said people will ultimately gravitate toward who they think has the best chance of winning and added that he harbored no ill will toward DeSantis. “I think Ron DeSantis has been a good governor of Florida,” he told News Agency. “And I look forward to having him come back as governor.” CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to better describe Justin Caporale’s work for Donald Trump.

Another state lawmaker, spurned by DeSantis earlier this year, is actively recruiting more of his colleagues to jump on the Trump bandwagon. Meanwhile, a cadre of former DeSantis political operatives who stopped working for the governor on poor terms are now entrenched in Trump world and motivated to embarrass their former boss. Welcome to the2024Revenge Tour. In the tug of war for home-state supremacy, Trump has gained the upper hand in part by exploiting rifts between DeSantis and Florida Republicans. The strategy has played out easier than the former president’s team anticipated, as DeSantis has left a wake of ill will in the state on the path to political stardom. As the 2024 campaign descends on Florida in the coming days, the ever-evolving relationship between the state’s Republicans and these two leading figures will be on full display. Trump, DeSantis and the rest of the GOP primary field addressed Florida Republicans at a state party event Saturday just outside Orlando. DeSantis had a midday time slot, sandwiched between Florida Sen. Rick Scott, his predecessor in Tallahassee who he doesn’t get along with, and state Rep. Randy Fine, the state’s only Jewish Republican lawmaker who recently asserted DeSantis hasn’t done enough to stop Nazis and antisemitism in Florida. Scott announced Thursday he was endorsing Trump, while Fine switched his allegiance to the former president last month. In his remarks Saturday, DeSantis said he was not concerned about Florida state lawmakers flipping their endorsement to Trump, telling the audience, “It’s a dynamic thing.” “No, look — this happens in these things. I mean, we’ve had flips the other way in other states,” DeSantis said, adding that “politicians do what they’re gonna do.” Christie, Hutchinson receive hostile reception at Florida Republican summit Trump closed out the gathering, touting the new endorsements from Florida lawmakers and bringing several of them onstage. The crowd laughed and cheered as Trump bashed DeSantis over his slip in national and state polls. The Sunshine State battle will continue Wednesday, when the Republican Party will hold its third presidential debate in Miami. Trump, who is skipping the debate once again, has scheduled counterprogramming just down the road in Hialeah. The next day, Trump will host Florida Republicans at Mar-a-Lago, a continuation of his courtship of party leaders and donors, while DeSantis will attend fundraisers in the state. At the same time, in a demonstration of DeSantis’ continued command over the GOP-controlled state Legislature, lawmakers are returning to Tallahassee next week at his urging to pass new sanctions against Iran following Hamas’ attack on Israel last month. They will also seek to address the state’s property insurance crisis, a concern that continues to generate negative headlines for DeSantis back home. The governor’s influence in the Sunshine State, once unquestioned, has repeatedly taken hits in recent months. His struggles as a presidential candidate have emboldened some Republicans here to break from DeSantis less than a year after he orchestrated the most dominant electoral victory in a Florida gubernatorial race in modern history. With the Iowa caucuses fast approaching, Trump’s lead in early nominating states and national polls appears sturdy while DeSantis has slipped into a distant second place alongside a surging Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor. His attempts to reassert himself as the state’s dominant political force have repeatedly run into enemies he has accumulated over the past decade. While DeSantis dismissed Fine as seeking “15 minutes of fame,” the governor’s allies are bracing for more state lawmakers to change their allegiance. One DeSantis adviser said they expect as many as six Republicans in the Legislature to flip sides, mostly freshmen lawmakers elected last year. State Sen. Joe Gruters, a former state party chair who DeSantis regularly iced out, is helping to lure more Republicans to Trump and said he expects to have a “pretty good group” to announce in the coming weeks. He conceded, though, that most lawmakers will remain behind DeSantis, which he attributed to the persuasive power of the governor’s line-item veto authority — a reality he experienced firsthand when DeSantis cut his projects out of the state budget earlier this year after Gruters endorsed Trump. Gruters recently secured another key win for Trump in the Sunshine State: overturning an attempt by DeSantis allies to force presidential candidates to sign a loyalty pledge to make Florida’s primary ballot. The overwhelming vote to scrap the proposal demonstrated Trump’s enduring popularity among Republican Party officials and served as a crushing defeat for DeSantis loyalists. “That was like throwing the hammer down,” Gruters said. “That reconfirmed that this is the president’s party.” State House Speaker Paul Renner said most Republican lawmakers are behind DeSantis because he has demonstrated he’s better positioned to carry GOP successes in Florida to the national stage. “Elections are about the future and not the past,” Renner said. “Those of us that live here and those of us that work closely with his team know this is a guy that delivers results.” DeSantis’ campaign insists the governor remains well positioned in his home state.

When DeSantis launched a national tour to promote a new book last spring, Caporale, a longtime Trump aide, privately discouraged Republican operatives from working for the Florida governor or face excommunication from Trump world. Caporale made it clear at the time that this extended to a potential Trump White House. A source said this is no longer in effect as DeSantis has slipped in the polls. Gruters said people will ultimately gravitate toward who they think has the best chance of winning and added that he harbored no ill will toward DeSantis. “I think Ron DeSantis has been a good governor of Florida,” he told News Agency. “And I look forward to having him come back as governor.” CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to better describe Justin Caporale’s work for Donald Trump.

But at this moment of war and mass death, this proposition is worth reflecting on: Palestine cannot be free without Israel – or at least the Israelis – being free. True freedom between the river and the sea can only be achieved by breaking free from the chains of settler-colonialism but also the narrow bounds of the nation-state. Before I explain further, let me get into the current debate over the slogan “river to the sea”. When most Israelis, and no doubt a significant number of Palestinians, hear the phrase “river to the sea,” they imagine it in exclusivist terms. This is not surprising. The zero-sum understanding of the nation-state – a specific territory under the exclusive control of one national community, has been the determinative communal identity for at least four centuries. Its logic is as simple as it is violent: if this territory belongs to my group, it cannot belong to yours. Not every country’s identity and politics are based on this logic, but many are. Even countries with a long tradition of intercommunal tolerance can rapidly veer towards chauvinism. The dynamics are even clearer in settler-colonial societies, where the settler community has to conquer the territory and subdue or expel the Indigenous population in order to build its own society. Genocide is more often than not a core experience of this process. Israel is, of course, the quintessential settler-colonial society; yet it is also one whose maximalist impulse has yet to be realised. Palestinians have not been reduced to a manageably small minority who can be given formal political rights and then ignored, repressed and extracted without meaningful resistance – as was the fate of Indigenous Americans and Australians. Given the violence inherent to colonialism, Indigenous resistance has naturally been imagined by settler societies as the mirror image of their eliminationist impulses and policies: We want them gone and will commit whatever violence is necessary to achieve that goal, so they must want and would do the same. Not surprisingly, when resistance does take the form of mass violence, as happened on October 7, that imagination is powerfully reinforced. In this context, when most Zionist Israelis and Israel supporters hear the phrase “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free”, they hear “a genocidal callto violence to destroy the state of Israel and its people to replace it with a Palestinian state extending from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea”. The fact that some Palestinians, particularly Hamas, have leaned hard into a violently exclusivist connotation of the phrase only serves to reinforce the idea. But Hamas has never represented most Palestinians, despite the concerted efforts of the movement and successive Israeli governments (for very different reasons) to elevate its status. Its popularity in, if not control over, Gaza had waned significantly before the October 7 attack. Into this deeply dysfunctional mix enters Representative Rashida Tlaib, currently the only Palestinian American member of the United States Congress. Along with her colleague Ilhan Omar and occasionally other members of “The Squad”, she has been the only national political voice advocating unhesitatingly for Palestinian rights. For the vast majority of her congressional colleagues and most who describe themselves as “pro-Israel”, Tlaib’s use of the “river to the sea” slogan permanently marked her as an enemy of Israel. This was why, on November 6, she was officially censured by the House of Representatives. Of course, Palestinians are not the only ones advocating a “river-to-sea” discourse. It has more or less been the official policy of the Israeli state since 1967, when it occupied the West Bank, Gaza and the Golan Heights. Since then, every Israeli government has pushed for the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, rendering the two-state solution an impossibility well before the Oslo peace process began. Within the Israeli political space, from the far-right to the liberal left, the idea of sharing the land with the Palestinians as equals was never on the table. The problem Israel has faced – like other settler-colonial powers – has been that Indigenous populations rarely if ever go gentle into that good night. Revisionist Zionism founder Ze’ev Jabotinsky would not have disagreed with Tlaib’s argument in the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attack, that the “suffocating, dehumanising conditions” of permanent occupation inevitably “lead to resistance”. Exactly a century ago, in his 1923 manifesto, The Iron Wall, he advocated overwhelming Jewish power to turn Palestine from the river to the sea into a Jewish ethnostate precisely because of the inevitability of Palestinian resistance. Regardless of whose side one is on, as long as the understanding of the “river-to-sea” discourse is filtered through the prism of the inherently colonial nation-state, one’s imagination of other possibilities will be highly constrained. And a far more expansive imagination is precisely what is most desperately needed today, not only to establish freedom, justice and peace for all the inhabitants of Palestine/Israel in the midst of the present horror, but to address humanity’s myriad existential problems, in which the Israeli occupation is deeply embedded. In that regard, Tlaib’s argument – echoed by innumerable Palestinian activists and their allies, including many Jews – that “from the River to the Sea is an aspirational call for freedom, human rights and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction or hate” represents a radically post-nationalist imagination of the future in Palestine and Israel. In fact, it is one that Palestinians on the front lines of the occupation, joined by Israeli and international solidarity activists, have been putting into practice, however tentatively and against overwhelming force, for decades, as anyone who is engaged in solidarity work in the occupied territories will attest. To share a communal meal in Nabi Saleh or Bil’in, Atwani or the Jordan Valley after a day spent planting or harvesting olive trees, walking children to school, facing off against Israeli settlers, bulldozers or tear gas – and now to struggle daily together in the US and across the West, is to repeat an experience common to theFreedom Riders, the multi-racial African National Congress, and others who struggled for freedom. Intercommunal solidarity and joint action towards a common future were central to all these struggles, as they pushed for imagining possibilities for sharing land, resources and power that previously seemed naïve, far-fetched or even dangerous. Every day, more and more Jews and others join Palestinians in causing precisely the sort of “good trouble” that previously helped end – however imperfectly – apartheid in America and South Africa, and formal colonial rule across the Global South. There is a growing awareness, particularly among young people, that the stakes of Gaza extend beyond Palestine and Israel, representing the front lines of a battle for the future, for the possibility of humanity not being engulfed by growing violence and inequality as we veer towards ever more deadly threats to our collective survival. For those still trapped inside binary identities and safely ensconced in an increasingly psychopathic global capitalist system, a free Palestine from the river to the sea – indeed, a truly free, equal and sustainable world – remains an unthinkable proposition. But as the latest wave of violence confirms, Israel cannot be free until Palestine is free, and the price of that freedom is real decolonisation. This means the creation of a political order, whatever its name or form, in which all people living between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea are accorded the same fundamental rights and freedoms. In the face of the horrors of Gaza, we should be working to encourage real decolonisation not just in Israel/Palestine, but globally, before the violence engulfs us all.

Every day, more and more Jews and others join Palestinians in causing precisely the sort of “good trouble” that previously helped end – however imperfectly – apartheid in America and South Africa, and formal colonial rule across the Global South. There is a growing awareness, particularly among young people, that the stakes of Gaza extend beyond Palestine and Israel, representing the front lines of a battle for the future, for the possibility of humanity not being engulfed by growing violence and inequality as we veer towards ever more deadly threats to our collective survival. For those still trapped inside binary identities and safely ensconced in an increasingly psychopathic global capitalist system, a free Palestine from the river to the sea – indeed, a truly free, equal and sustainable world – remains an unthinkable proposition. But as the latest wave of violence confirms, Israel cannot be free until Palestine is free, and the price of that freedom is real decolonisation. This means the creation of a political order, whatever its name or form, in which all people living between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea are accorded the same fundamental rights and freedoms. In the face of the horrors of Gaza, we should be working to encourage real decolonisation not just in Israel/Palestine, but globally, before the violence engulfs us all.

Lauren Boebert, during a visit to her Colorado district. During his speech, Biden touted provisions of his administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, which he pledged would bring jobs to the local community while issuing a blistering critique of Boebert. Biden said the controversial congresswoman is “one of the leaders of this extreme MAGA movement.” He lit into Boebert for voting against his legislative agenda, criticizing her for comments calling the bipartisan infrastructure law “garbage” and “a scam.” “She, along with every single Republican colleague, voted against the law that made these investments in jobs possible,” Biden said. “And then she voted to repeal key parts of this law, and she called this law a massive failure. You all know you’re part of a massive failure? Tell that to the 850 Coloradans who got new jobs. … It all sounds like a massive failure in thinking by the congresswoman and her colleagues.” Biden and Boebert have clashed in the past and the trip to the conservative congresswoman’s district came as she faces a tough reelection bid in 2024. Earlier this year, Democrat Adam Frisch – whonarrowly lost to the incumbent Boebert in 2022’s midterm elections– announced he would again mount a campaignto unseat her in 2024. Boebert slammed Biden in a statement ahead of his visit. “Families in Colorado’s 3rd Congressional District are being crushed by so-called ‘Bidenomics.’ On Joe Biden’s watch, credit card debt, inflation, groceries, and gas prices have all reached record highs. These high prices are squeezing working-class Coloradans and rural America,” Boebert said in a statement. She added, “Instead of touting the poorly named Inflation Reduction Act that mandated Green New Deal policies which cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars, Joe Biden should work with me to get my Pueblo Jobs Act signed into law that will create 1,000 new jobs in Pueblo and help revitalize Southern Colorado’s economy.” The president has been at odds with Boebert in the past – in 2022, she interrupted Biden’s State of the Union address as he paid tribute to members of the armed forces who were sickened by burn pits, including his son Beau Biden who died from brain cancer in 2015. The Colorado Republican shouted, “You put them there—13 of them,” in an apparent reference tosoldiers killed during the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan. The congresswoman drew negative headlines in September after she was escorted out of a Denver production of “Beetlejuice: The Musical,” following complaints she and a companion were “vaping, singing, causing a disturbance.” During his speech, the president detailed a slew of benefits Colorado has seen under the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act and the bipartisan infrastructure law while criticizing House Republicans, noting, “We haven’t gotten a whole lot of help from some members of Congress on the other side of the aisle.” “The speaker, Donald Trump, and the MAGA Republicans here in Congress are committed to protecting outrageous tax cuts for those at the very top, and they’re going to continue to oppose investing in all those programs that help people – whether it’s in education, health care, whatever,” he warned. “I have a different view.” Biden’s trip to Pueblo wasn’t the first time the president has brought the fight with House Republicans to their front doors. In the last year, Biden’s visited districts in South Carolina, New York and Virginia to highlight lawmakers who’ve sought to block his domestic agenda. But it comes as Americans rate the president poorly on his handling of the economy. Ina Gallup pollreleased Tuesday, just 32% of those polled approve of his handling of the economy. As the Republican presidential primary field narrows, Biden has increased attacks on his predecessor, former President Donald Trump, and his “MAGA Republican” allies in Congress, going so far as to warn supporters during a Washington, DC, fundraiser last month that “Trump and the MAGA Republicans are determined to destroy this democracy.” During Wednesday’s speech, he noted that Speaker Mike Johnson and Florida Republican Rep. Vern Buchanan traveled to Sarasota, Florida, Tuesday, and touted construction of a new airport terminal made possible by funding from the infrastructure law. “Both the speaker and the congressman voted against the law and spoke against the law – but now they’re down there taking credit for it being built,” Biden said. “As my mother would say, God love ‘em. As one of my friends back home would say, that’s real chutzpah.” The trip to Pueblo was originally scheduled for last month as part of Biden’s “Invest in America” tour aimed at highlighting the administration’s legislative achievements while contrasting them with House Republicans’ agenda. But the spiraling conflict following Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel prompted the White Houseto postpone the trip while the president attended national security meetings at the White Houseand later visited Israel. During the trip, Biden visited CS Wind, the world’s largest wind tower manufacturer, pointing to the company’s new $200 million Pueblo, Colorado, facility expansion – an expansion both the company and the Biden administration havedirectly attributed to passage of 2022’s Inflation Reduction Act. The visit coincides with a new report from the Treasury Department outlining the impact of the IRA — 14 investments totaling $985.5 million have been announced in Colorado since the law’s passage last year, with 99% of investment dollars headed to counties with below-average wages. In a fact sheet shared with News Agency ahead of Biden’s visit, the administration also took care to tout a series of investments in the district, including a new solar field, expanded high-speed internet for the area, a Main Street revitalization project in Delta, Colorado, and a pipeline project all made possible under the IRA and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. “These investments and jobs wouldn’t be possible without President Biden and Congressional Democrats,” an official told News Agency Tuesday. “And it’s important for Americans to know that if Republicans in Congress—including self-identified MAGA Republican Representative Lauren Boebert—want to undermine their communities by taking those investments and opportunities away.” CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the name of Rep.

Washington, DC –The next speaker of the United States House of Representatives will face a gruelling task: maintaining near unanimous support among a divided Republican caucus while reaching agreements with Democrats to fund the government. Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy found out the hard way that the two jobs can be at odds with one another. When hestruck a dealwith Democrats to temporarily fund the government on Saturday, he sparked a Republican backlash that culminated in his removal from the speakership position. The Republicans have a thin majority in the House, so the same small faction of conservatives — led byCongressman Matt Gaetz— that toppled McCarthy can also remove his eventual successor. That has instilled an atmosphere of uncertainty moving forward. “There’s a fear that they will just continue to do this to any speaker. And obviously, that creates a really chaotic environment where the House can’t consider bills,” said Rachel Blum, a professor of political science at the University of Oklahoma. With that threat hanging over the next speaker, experts say the House and the US government more broadly are facing the possibility of chronic dysfunction in the months ahead. McCarthy, a California conservative, was removed in a 216-210 vote on Tuesday, with the entire Democratic caucus joining eight Republicans to remove him. Now, House Republicans are privately deliberating to choose the next speaker, with Patrick McHenry serving as the acting leader of the chamber. Jim Jordan, the chair of the House Judiciary Committee and former head of the right-wing Freedom Caucus, has announced his candidacyfor the role. So has Steve Scalise, the House majority leader. Whoever wins will need to appease Gaetz and his fellow disruptors in the Republican caucus while running a functioning chamber. It is with a strong sense of responsibility and purpose that I seek the House Republican Conference’s nomination for Speaker of the House. Read my letter to my colleagues:pic.twitter.com/G6YDd2SjCD — Steve Scalise (@SteveScalise)October 4, 2023  The government is divided: Democrats control the Senate and the White House, while Republicans are in charge of the House. Given that split, Congress is not expected to advance major legislation. But the legislative branch — composed of both the House and the Senate — must pass a budget to fund the government. The recently approved stopgap funding bill that cost McCarthy his gavel will expire on November 17. If lawmakers fail to approve further funding, the governmentwill shut down, which would bring some agencies to a halt and cause disruptions in the pay of federal workers. Another compromise to secure agovernment budgetwill be more difficult this time around, experts say. “I can’t see the next Republican speaker stepping into that role and taking from this McCarthy episode the lesson that he should continue to compromise,” Blum told News Agency. “It seems that any speaker is going to have to put up a little bit more of a fight in order to maintain the speakership.” Another issue at stake is Ukraine aid — a top priority for President Joe Biden’s administration. Many right-wing Republicans are sceptical of providing more assistance and would likely use their leverage over the speaker to disrupt it. The White House is seeking billions in additional aid to Kyiv. According to the Congressional Research Service, the US legislature has appropriated more than$113bnfor Ukraine since the Russian invasion of the country began last year. It is not clear when those funds will run out. With so much in the balance, some observers are questioning why the Democrats did not bail out McCarthy in his hour of need. While Gaetz is largely credited with toppling McCarthy, the overwhelming majority of the votes against him came from Democrats. Every single Democrat present for the vote backed Gaetz’smotion to vacatethe speaker’s chair. A handful of Democratic votes would have allowed McCarthy to keep the speaker’s gavel. Adam Cayton, a political science professor at the University of West Florida, said that if the Democrats had voted to save McCarthy, the move would have been unprecedented. Cayton explained that while McCarthy’s removal is a first in US history, having a minority-backed speaker would “also be really out of the ordinary”. He stressed that the House operates on majority rule. “It also would have been unprecedented for the minority party to support a speaker of the other party, to let him stay in office in spite of not having the support of a majority of the chamber,” Cayton told News Agency. McCarthy had angered Democrats from the start of his tenure as speaker in January. Early on, he removed three Democratic lawmakers from their committees, including booting RepresentativeIlhan Omarfrom the foreign affairs panel. And last month, he openedan impeachment inquiryagainst Biden over his son Hunter’s business dealings, which the White House described as “extreme politics at its worst”. Moreover, McCarthy ruled out negotiating with the Democrats to get their votes this week. “They haven’t asked for anything. I’m not going to provide anything,” he told CNBC earlier this week. In a statement before the vote, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries squarely blamed Republicans for the impasse, accusing them of empowering “right-wing extremists” and urging them to resolve their “civil war”. Jeffries also explicitly invoked the impeachment push. “Rather than work with us to solve problems for everyday Americans, extremism continues to run rampant in the House of Representatives,” he said.      But Jennifer Nicoll Victor, a political science professor at George Mason University in Virginia, faulted the Democrats for siding against McCarthy. She felt the move was unwarranted, particularly if their motive was to rebuke McCarthy’s antagonising conduct. “If in fact, it was a sort of a petty, emotional or reactionary kind of response that, to me, seems anti-democratic, against good governance, against the best practices of how democracies are supposed to work,” Victor said. “Political parties are supposed to respect their political opponents’ rights to power in a democracy,” she explained. “Being spiteful about helping some extreme faction depose your political opponents — I think goes against the norms of democracy.” Despite the grim outlook, a deadlock in the House is not inevitable. There are several scenarios where the chamber can do its job despite the political realities spelled out byMcCarthy’s removal. Republican moderates and Democrats could form a bipartisan majority to pass legislation, but analysts say that would be unlikely given the political polarisation in the country. It is also not a foregone conclusion that Gaetz and his allies will have it out for the next speaker the way they had McCarthy in their crosshairs. University of Oklahoma’s Blum said Gaetz and his fellow rebels may back down after achieving the visibility and power they desire. “One path forward is that the speaker can at least unite the Republican caucus, so they can agree and get things done,” she told News Agency. “Or they could end up with another speaker who has to govern with support from Democrats.” pic.twitter.com/LlqFb2XtP0 — Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan)October 5, 2023  But for Victor, the likeliest outcome is that dysfunction will prevail, with the Gaetz faction feeling emboldened. Moderates may even rebel against a future far-right speaker. “We’ll probably just hobble through that way — whether that means they can’t get the spending done and we have another shutdown, or ifthe debt ceilingbecomes another issue at some point, or no new legislation gets done because they can’t get their act together,” she said. “It seems like a dysfunctional situation.” The only silver lining, she added, is that this Congress’s term will expire in a little more than a year. “So there is an endpoint.”          Follow News Agency English:",,Al Jazeera English,7671.0,1282

Moderates may even rebel against a future far-right speaker. “We’ll probably just hobble through that way — whether that means they can’t get the spending done and we have another shutdown, or ifthe debt ceilingbecomes another issue at some point, or no new legislation gets done because they can’t get their act together,” she said. “It seems like a dysfunctional situation.” The only silver lining, she added, is that this Congress’s term will expire in a little more than a year. “So there is an endpoint.”          Follow News Agency English:",,Al Jazeera English,7671.0,1282

Much of the British political establishment’s stance on Palestine, including that of the Labour Party, is and has always been morally corrupt. More than a century ago, in 1917, the United Kingdom paved the way for the ethnic cleansing and oppression of the Palestinian people with the Balfour Declaration, which promised British patronage of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Today, Britain’s political establishment – both Conservative and Labour –  is working to ensure the continuation of this oppression by supporting and providing impunity for Israeli regime’s war crimes in Gaza. The establishment’s unconditional support for the Israeli regime – and disregard for Palestinian suffering – was fully on display on Wednesday during a House of Commons vote on an amendment to the King’s Speech put forward by the Scottish National Party that called for a ceasefire in Gaza. In the end, the amendment failed with 293 MPs voting against it. Just 125 MPs, including 56 Labour MPs who defied their party whip, voted for the amendment and thus for a ceasefire that would save countless Palestinian lives. Among the Labour MPs who voted with their conscience and against the establishment position were eight shadow ministers who subsequently had to leave their front bench positions. The official Labour Party line since the beginning of this latest bombardment of Gaza has been to unequivocally support the Israeli regime. Labour Party leader Keir Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, went so far as to say during a radio interview that theIsraeli regime has the right to cut offaccess to water, food and electricity for Palestinians in Gaza. Of course, as Starmer undoubtedly knows, such actions are in fact considered collective punishment, and thus a war crime, under international law. But this wasn’t surprising from Starmer, who has been rooting out Palestinian solidarity from within the ranks of Labour since the beginning of his tenure as party leader. The previous Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, had broken ranks with the establishment and positioned the party as a firm critic of Israeli regime policies towards Palestinians. Corbyn’s principled stance on Palestine was an anomaly in the history of the party. Indeed, the Labour Party’s stance on the rights of the Palestinian people has always been dismissive at best. In 1948, the silence of the British left – from the communists to the Labour Party – on the mass expulsion of Palestinians from their homeland was resounding. Former British Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson was an advocate of Zionism and considered the Israeli regime a “wonderful experiment in Socialist politics”. For many in the party, there was no contradiction in merging socialism (or Labor Zionism) with settler colonialism. Even in 1967 when the Israeli regime occupied the rest of historic Palestine, the Labour Partymaintained a consensuson support for the Zionist project. It was the Israeli Labour Party that spearheaded the settlements in the West Bank, Gaza and Syria’s Golan Heights in direct contradiction of UNResolution 242calling for the immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces from newly occupied territories. This, however, did not sour the good relationship between the two parties. In fact, the 1960s and 1970s has been described as the“golden years”of cooperation between them. Under Prime Minister Tony Blair’s leadership, the party further cemented its ties with the Israeli regime. In 2006, Blair’s Labourrefused to call for a ceasefire inthe Israeli regime’s war against Lebanon, in which more than 1,400 Lebanese were killed. When Blair stepped down as prime minister and Labour leader in 2007, he immediately assumed the position of representative to the Quartet, the international body overseeing the so-called “Israeli-Palestinian peace process”, based in East Jerusalem. Throughout his tenure at the Quartet, the former Labour prime minister was accused of pursuing political deals that would line his pockets and hinder the Palestinian struggle for justice and liberation. He, for example, famously secured radio frequencies from the Israeli regime for the West Bank and Gaza, which allowed for the establishment of the second Palestinian mobile phone operator, Wataniya Mobile. What is not widely known is that Watinaya is owned by atelecom company that is a client of JP Morgan, for which Blair was a special adviser. In return for this, the Palestinian Authority was pressured to drop its attempt to pursue in the UN evidence of war crimes committed in Gaza by the Israeli regime during its 2008–2009 Operation Cast Lead. The Labour establishment has always been complicit in the oppression of the Palestinian people, but their moral corruption on Palestine is not representative of the contemporary Labour grassroots. In fact, trade unionists, councillors and students groups affiliated with the Labour Party are a significant part of the ever-growing Palestine solidarity movement in the UK. And we have seen Labour councillors resign from their positions over the party’s line on Palestine –so far more than 30. This latest assault on Gaza has highlighted existing tensions within the Labour Party – tensions between the upper echelons offering near unconditional support to the Israeli regime and a grassroots that views support for the Palestinian struggle as the cornerstone of a genuinely leftist and progressive political agenda. Indeed, many on the British left can see the moral corruption of the Labour establishment on the issue of Palestine and recognise its interdependence with other social and racial justice issues. They understand, for instance, one cannot object to the mass deportation of asylum seekers while turning a blind eye to the Palestinian people’s struggle to return to live freely in their homeland. This is why Wednesday’s vote was important, especially for the Labour Party. It was not only an attempt to save lives in Gaza but also an opportunity to take a stand as a supposedly left-wing party against war, Western imperialism and colonialism. Labour once again failed to take this stand, and to be honest, I am sceptical that it will ever do so.

For more than two hours of arguments the justices were receptive to a key section of a lower court opinion that scaled back on the agency’s ability to enforce securities law, although they did not seem poised to address some broader aspects of the controversial ruling. Conservative justices suggested that the agency’s decision to allow some disputes to be heard by in house administrative law judges, instead of filing suit in federal court, violates an individual’s right to trial by jury under the Seventh Amendment. Idaho asks Supreme Court to let abortion law that penalizes doctors to take full effect If the court holds that the SEC’s method of adjudicating certain fraud claims violates the Constitution, it could impact other agencies that use similar proceedings such as the Social Security Administration. Chief Justice John Roberts worried about an enforcement proceeding with “no court” and “no jury.” Roberts said he found it “curious” that a person would have a right to a jury “until the government decides you don’t have that right.” Justice Neil Gorsuch repeatedly emphasized the foundational Seventh Amendment right. “We’d agree that the right to trial by jury, whether it’s criminal or civil is a very important foundational freedom in American Society,” he said. Justice Samuel Alito asked whether “the right to a trial by jury simply goes out the window” when the government brings an enforcement proceeding. Another concern expressed by Roberts and Gorsuch is that the SEC plays a more dominant role in enforcement than it has in past decades. Nodding to a constant refrain from those who believe agencies have become too powerful, Gorsuch quipped: “This is not your grandfather’s SEC.” Justice Brett Kavanaugh pushed back on the government’s argument that in-house proceedings passed legal muster because they concerned a so called “public right” that are subject to more legislative control. “It does seem odd from a constitutional perspective to say that a private suit triggers the Article Three right to a federal court and a jury against you for money, but a government suit against you for money is somehow exempt from” those courts, he said. The case is one of several this term where the conservative leaning majority is taking a hard look at the structure of government out of a belief that in recent years independent agencies – unaccountable to the public – have become too unwieldy. Central to Wednesday’s discussion was the latest controversial opinion from the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals – one of the most conservative appellate courts in the country that covers Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas – where conservative litigants often file suit hoping for eventual Supreme Court review. The SEC consists of five members appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The commission can enforce a variety of federal statutes in two ways. It can institute administrative enforcement proceedings seeking civil penalties, or it may bring civil actions in federal court. The case arose in 2013 after the SEC brought an enforcement action for securities fraud against George Jarkesy, who had established two hedge funds with his advisory firm, Patriot28. The funds brought in over 100 investors and held about $24 million in assets. An SEC administrative law judge found Jarkesy had violated the Securities Act, Exchange Act and Advisers Act for fraud actions. He was ordered to pay a civil penalty of $300,000, and to repay nearly $685,000 in ill-gotten gains. Jarkesy was also barred from various securities industry activities including serving as an investment adviser. Jarkesy, however, challenged the proceedings arguing they violated the Constitution, and won in the 5th Circuit. The federal appeals court ruled in favor of Jarkesy on three separate constitutional claims. It held that certain of the SEC’s proceedings deprive individuals of their Seventh Amendment right to a civil jury. In addition, the court said that Congress had improperly delegated legislative power to the SEC which gave the agency unconstrained authority at times to choose the in-house administrative proceeding rather than filing suit in district court. The court emphasized that under precedent, Congress can only grant regulatory power to another entity if it provides an “intelligible principle” to guide the proceedings. “The Constitution,” the court held, “provides strict rules to ensure that Congress exercises the legislative power in a way that comports with the People’s will.” The conservative appellate court also said that rules allowing for the removal of SEC administrative law judges only for “good cause” – are unconstitutional because they insulate the judges from the presidents’ ability to remove them for any reason in violation of the separation of powers. On Wednesday, however, the court seemed to center only on one part of the opinion having to do with the Seventh Amendment right to a jury, suggesting that it may never reach the other parts of the federal appeals court sprawling decision. In court, Principal Deputy Solicitor General Brian Fletcher rejected any claim that Congress violated the Seventh Amendment right by allowing in house proceedings. “Congress does not violate the Seventh Amendment when it authorizes an agency to impose civil penalties and administrative proceedings to enforce a federal statute,” he said. S. Michael McColloch, an attorney for Jarkesy, relied on history to make his argument that the use of in house proceedings against Jarkesy was “anti-ethical” to the founders’ intent. For their part liberal justices on the bench repeatedly pressed McColloch for the limits of his position and how it might impact other agencies. Justice Elena Kagan pointed to historical events such as the depression, savings and loan crisis and recessions and asked whether Congress is entitled to deference when giving the SEC greater powers. Nodding to her Jewish faith, Kagan said some of McColloch’s arguments amounted to “chutzpah to quote my people.” A group of administrative law scholars in support of the SEC argued in a friend of the court brief that if the justices were to rule that the SEC’s proceedings violate the Seventh Amendment’s right to a trial by jury it would have a “devastating” impact on other agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission, Department of Labor and the National Labor Relations Board. The 5th Circuit’s decision, their lawyer Alan Morrison argued, “was made without proper appreciation for the need for Congress to have flexibility when it seeks to solve important problems by making use of agency adjudication in today’s regulatory framework.” Morrison also believes the lower court was wrong when it comes to the removal procedures applicable to the SEC administrative law judges. As things stand the administrative judges can only be removed if they have done something glaringly wrong. The 5th Circuit essentially said the president should be able to fire them for any reason – or no reason. “That is wrong,” Morrison said in an interview. “Nothing in the Constitution forbids Congress from assuring that administrative judges do not serve at the whim of their agency heads in order to protect the rights of those who appear before them.” Lawyers for the Chamber of Commerce support Jarkesy and argue the case presents the court “with another opportunity to reaffirm the structural limitations of the Constitution,” noting that like other financial regulatory agencies the SEC is responsible for creating substantive rules and “levying knee-buckling penalties against private citizens.” “The growth of the administrative state has eroded” safeguards, lawyer Steven A. Engel argued on behalf of the chamber.",,CNN,50783.0,1277

In a radio interview Tuesday, she pointed to the races in Virginia and Ohio as areas where abortion is on the ballot. “Virginia is now the only state in the south without an abortion ban. But Virginia Republicans tried to pass one, and Gov. Youngkin said he would sign any ban that gets to his desk. When we think about what that means to take away the right of a woman to make decisions, having the freedom to make decision with her pastor or priest or her Rabbi but not having her government tell her what to do. It’s a very big issue,” she said during an appearance on “Joe Madison The Black Eagle” on Sirius XM airing Tuesday, making a last-minute appeal to Black voters on Election Day.

Israel’s deadly bombardment of Gaza has killed nearly 15,000 people, including 10,000 women and children, in over 50 days, making it the deadliest war for the besieged Palestinian enclave till date. Israel has rebuffed calls for a ceasefire as a four-day humanitarian truce comes to an end on November 28. It is unclear whether the truce will be extended. The devastation of Gaza and the mounting death toll has triggered worldwide protests, bringing the decades-long issue to the centre-stage of global politics. The Israeli-Palestinian issue goes back nearly a century when Britain, during World War I, pledged to establish a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine under theBalfour Declaration. British troops took control of the territory from the Ottoman Empire at the end of October 1917.  A large-scale Jewish migration to Palestine began, accelerated by Jewish people fleeing Nazism in Europe. Between 1918 and 1947, the Jewish population in Palestine increased from 6 percent to 33 percent. Palestinians were alarmed by the demographic change and tensions rose, leading to thePalestinian revoltfrom 1936 to 1939. Meanwhile, Zionist organisations continued to campaign for a homeland for Jews in Palestine. Armed Zionist militias started to attack the Palestinian people, forcing them to flee. Zionism, which emerged as a political ideology in the late 19th century, called for the creation of a Jewish homeland.  As violence ravaged Palestine, the matter was referred to the newly formed United Nations. In 1947, the UN adopted Resolution 181, which called for the partition of Palestine into Arab and Jewish states, handing over about55 percentof the land to Jews. Arabs were granted 45 percent of the land, while Jerusalem was declared a separate internationalised territory.  The city is currently divided between West Jerusalem, which is predominantly Jewish, and East Jerusalem with a majority Palestinian population. Israel captured East Jerusalem after the Six-Day War in 1967 along with the West Bank – a step not recognised by the international community. The Old City in occupied East Jerusalem holds religious significance for Christians, Muslims, and Jews. It is home to Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, which is known to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif and to Jews as Temple Mount. In 1981, the UN designated it a World Heritage Site.  Leading up to Israel’s birth in 1948, more than 750,000 Palestinians were ethnically cleansed from their homes by Zionist militias. This mass exodus came to be known as theNakbaor catastrophe. A further 300,000 Palestinians weredisplacedby theSix-Day War in 1967.   Israel declared the annexation of East Jerusalem in 1980, but the international community still considers it an occupied territory. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. In 1993, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin signed theOslo Accords, which aimed to achieve peace within five years. It was the first time the two sides recognised each other. A second agreement in 1995 divided the occupied West Bank into three parts – Area A, B and C. The Palestinian Authority, which was created in the wake of the Oslo Accords, was offered only limited rule on 18 percent of the land as Israel effectively continued to control the West Bank.  However, the Oslo Accords slowly broke down asIsraeli settlements, Jewish communities built on Palestinian land in the West Bank, grew at a rapid pace. The settlement populationin the West Bank and East Jerusalem grew from approximately 250,000 in 1993 to up to 700,000 in September this year. About three million Palestinians live in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. The building of Israeli settlements and aseparation wallon occupied territories has fragmented the the Palestinian communities and restricted their mobility. About 700 road obstacles, including 140 checkpoints, dot the West Bank. About 70,000 Palestinians with Israeli work permits cross these checkpoints in their daily commute. Settlementsare consideredillegal under international law. The UN has condemned settlements, calling ita big hurdlein the realisation of a viable Palestinian state as part of the so-called“two-state solution”.  Israel imposed a blockade on Gaza in 2007 after the Hamas group came to power. The siege continues till date. Israel also occupies the West Bank and East Jerusalem – the territories Palestinians want to be part of their future state. Israel imposeda total blockadeon the Gaza Strip on October 9, cutting its supplies of electricity, food, water, and fuel in the wake ofa surprise Hamas attackinside Israel. At least 1,200 people were killed in that attack.  This is what Israel and Palestine look like now.  Today, about 5 million Palestinians live in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem and 1.6 million Palestinians are citizens of Israel. This makes up about half of their total population. The other half lives in other countries, including Arab countries. There are about 14.7 million Jews around the world today, of which 84 percent live in Israel and the United States. The rest live in other countries including France, Canada, Argentina and Russia.   Here is an account of Palestinian and Israeli lives lost to the violence between 2008 and 2023.

Israel’s deadly bombardment of Gaza has killed nearly 15,000 people, including 10,000 women and children, in over 50 days, making it the deadliest war for the besieged Palestinian enclave till date. Israel has rebuffed calls for a ceasefire as a four-day humanitarian truce comes to an end on November 28. It is unclear whether the truce will be extended. The devastation of Gaza and the mounting death toll has triggered worldwide protests, bringing the decades-long issue to the centre-stage of global politics. The Israeli-Palestinian issue goes back nearly a century when Britain, during World War I, pledged to establish a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine under theBalfour Declaration. British troops took control of the territory from the Ottoman Empire at the end of October 1917.  A large-scale Jewish migration to Palestine began, accelerated by Jewish people fleeing Nazism in Europe. Between 1918 and 1947, the Jewish population in Palestine increased from 6 percent to 33 percent. Palestinians were alarmed by the demographic change and tensions rose, leading to thePalestinian revoltfrom 1936 to 1939. Meanwhile, Zionist organisations continued to campaign for a homeland for Jews in Palestine. Armed Zionist militias started to attack the Palestinian people, forcing them to flee. Zionism, which emerged as a political ideology in the late 19th century, called for the creation of a Jewish homeland.  As violence ravaged Palestine, the matter was referred to the newly formed United Nations. In 1947, the UN adopted Resolution 181, which called for the partition of Palestine into Arab and Jewish states, handing over about55 percentof the land to Jews. Arabs were granted 45 percent of the land, while Jerusalem was declared a separate internationalised territory.  The city is currently divided between West Jerusalem, which is predominantly Jewish, and East Jerusalem with a majority Palestinian population. Israel captured East Jerusalem after the Six-Day War in 1967 along with the West Bank – a step not recognised by the international community.

On a conservative talk radio show the day the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade in June 2022, Johnson underscored Justice Clarence Thomas’s concurring opinion that the high court should reconsider those other landmark rulings. Johnson, citing his years as an attorney against “activist courts,” defended Thomas’ view, insisting that what Thomas was calling for was, “not radical. In fact, it’s the opposite of that.” “There’s been some really bad law made,” hesaid.“They’ve made a mess of our jurisprudence in this country for the last several decades. And maybe some of that needs to be cleaned up.” When asked about Johnson’s post-Roe comments, a spokesman for the congressman told News Agency that Johnson “views the cases as settled law.” Still, News Agency’s review of more than 100 of Johnson’s interviews, speeches and public commentary spanning his decades-long career as a lawmaker and attorney paints a picture of his governing ideals: Imprisoning doctorswho performabortions after six weeks; the Ten Commandmentsprominently displayedin public buildings; aneliminationof anti-hate-crime laws;Bible studyin public schools. Fromendorsinghard labor prison sentences for abortion providers to supporting thecriminalizationof gay sex, his staunchly conservative rhetoric is rooted in an era of “biblical morality,” thathe sayswas washed away with the counterculture in the 1960s. House Speaker Johnson meets with Trump at Mar-a-Lago “One of the primary purposes of the law in civil government is to restrain evil,” Johnson said on one radio showin 2010. “We have to acknowledge collectively that man is inherently evil and needs to be restrained.” His vision has been well received as a congressman in his deeply conservative district in western Louisiana. But his surprising rise to the speakership has brought his particularly subtle brand of fire-and-brimstone to second in line to the presidency — delivering him a national platform from which to shape and influence laws. Johnson’s endorsement of Thomas’ opinion, legal experts say, positioned him significantly outside the mainstream. “Speaker Johnson embraces a view that is not only outside of the mainstream but is so radical in terms of his endorsement of the Thomas position, that even the extremely conservative Supreme Court majority isn’t willing to go there,” said Norm Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute and a News Agency legal analyst. “It would take the country back more than a half-century.” News Agency unearthed more than two dozen radio interviews from Johnson’s time as an attorney at the socially conservative legal advocacy group Alliance Defense Fund (ADF) where Johnson litigated and voiced support for what he sometimes described as a battle for the country between the forces of good and evil. “The arrows in the culture war are particularly directed at our youth, where the Enemy often has the greatest effect,” read the2005webpage for “God & Country,” a Christian local radio show co-hosted by Johnson. “We cannot lose our children to the forces of darkness. Be aware and get active in your kids’ schools.” Topics discussedon the show included “creation science” in public schools; how to “fight the porn industry”; God’s “design for government”; and “the true meaning of ‘separation of church and state.’” As an attorney at ADF, Johnson repeatedly battled two organizations in his fight to keep religion in the public square: The American Civil Liberties Union, which hecalled“the most dangerous organization in America,” and Americans United for Separation of Church and State. The groups clashed over prayer in public schools, public displays of nativity scenes and the right to open public meetings with prayer. “They have convinced an entire generation of Americans that there’s this so-called separation of church and state,”Johnson saidin 2008 about the ACLU. Johnson’s rhetoric has tapped into a “persecution complex” for evangelicals as American culture leans increasingly left on social issues, said Ryan Burge, a political scientist at Eastern Illinois University and a Baptist pastor. “They want to feel embattled. They want to fight the culture war,” Burge told News Agency. “When he talks about Griswold and Lawrence, evangelicals know that what he really is saying to them is: ‘Our way of life is under attack and liberalism is on the march. Stand firm in our convictions,’” added Burge, referring to the landmark cases that legalized gay sex and contraception use. Johnson served not only as an attorney at ADF but a national spokesman for the organization, making appearances on radio and national television where he oftenaddressedso-called “right of conscience” cases involving Christian businesses. Discussingone casein New Mexico, where a wedding photography company was found in violation of the state’s anti-discrimination laws for refusing to photograph a same-sex couple’s commitment ceremony, Johnson argued anti-discrimination laws did not recognize a “behavior” like homosexuality. “There are laws on the books that prohibit discrimination against people for their immutable characteristics, their race and creed and that kind of thing,”Johnsonsaid in a 2009 radio interview. “There’s a difference – and the law has recognized a difference – between that and homosexual behavior. As something that you do, not an immutable characteristic of what you are.” The New Mexico Supreme Court disagreed and ruled against the company, which ADF represented. The Supreme Courtdeclinedto hear the case. Johnson “doesn’t understand the problem with a government compelling its citizens to follow not just religion, but a particular religion,” said Katherine Lewis Parker, the former legal director for the ACLU of North Carolina, who opposed Johnson in a lawsuit related to prayer at official meetings. In that 2007 suit, three residents in Forsyth County, North Carolina, argued local officials had an unconstitutional “practice of sponsoring sectarian prayer” with specific references to Jesus during meetings. Johnson defended the officials and argued that even in Congress, prayers often contain Christian references, which he called a “logical function of the nation’s demographics.” During a deposition, Johnson peppered one of the plaintiffs about what type of prayer would be acceptable in county meetings. “So if someone might be offended by virtually any prayer, should we just get rid of prayer entirely?” he asked. I think he is a true believer and I think he wants to blend religion and government. Kathleen Lewis Parker, former legal director for the ACLU of North Carolina An appeals court ruled against Johnson’s arguments in 2011, though the Supreme Court laterruledin favor of allowing such prayers in a separate case. “I think he is a true believer and I think he wants to blend religion and government,” Parker said of Johnson. Homosexuality was afrequent topicfor Johnson, which he has called “inherently unnatural” and a “dangerous lifestyle.” In addition to suggesting he hopes the Supreme Court will reverse its decision allowing same-sex marriage, he alsowrotein support of Texas’ anti-sodomy laws, which said gay men caught having sex could be fined. “It recognized a fundamental right, a constitutional right to, to sodomy, which had never been recognized before,” Johnson said at a forum in2005on the Supreme Court’s ruling in Lawrence v. Texas — which struck down the ban on gay sex in that state. Johnson supported an Arkansaslawagainst same-sex couples adopting children, citing it as “good public policy” in 2008. In 2013, he opposed President Barack Obama’s appointment of an “openly homosexual” ambassador, Wally Brewster, tothe Dominican Republic, calling it aprovocative move against the Catholic country. In 2015, transitioning from his role at ADF to a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives, Johnson sparked national controversy with the “Marriage and Conscience Act.”The billaimed to protect individuals objecting to same-sex marriage on religious grounds but facedoppositionfrom Johnson’s hometowneditorial board,businessleadersandeven Republicansin the state legislature. Critics argued it could enable discrimination against LGBTQ individuals by businesses. Following backlash, the bill never reached a vote. In response to the bill’s failure, then-Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, issued a similar executive order. “Apparently, defending religious liberty makes one ‘anti-gay’ now,”Johnson wroteon Facebook amid debate on the bill. Just two years later, Johnson moved from the state legislature to Congress where he’smaintaineda 92% rating from the CPAC Center for Legislative Accountability – 11% higherthanthe average Republican in 2022. In Congress, Johnson signed on to some of the toughest anti-abortion bills,such asa 2021 so-called “heartbeat bill,” which would essentially outlaw abortion after six weeks. He has repeatedly called states that allow abortion “pro-death” states. “It is truly an American holocaust,” Johnson said in May 2022on local DC radio. “The reality is that Planned Parenthood and all thesebig abortion (providers), they set up their clinics in inner cities. They regard these people as easy prey. I mean, it’s true.” Johnson alsosupportedplanstochangeMedicare and Social Security benefits while increasing the retirement age, emphasizing urgency in addressing escalating entitlement. He has blamed booming entitlements costs in part on abortion. “And you don’t have 40 or 50 million able-bodied workers in the economy,” Johnsonsaidon a podcast he co-hosts with his wife. “That would be paying taxes into the system to be able to support their elderly, you know, neighbors and friends.” On numerous occasions, Johnson also voiced approval for a Louisiana state trigger law – passed in 2006 – which banned abortion without exceptions for rape and incest the day Roe v. Wade was overturned. “I’m grateful to be from Louisiana, one of the dozen states or so that has a trigger law that will automatically become an abortion free state, pro-life,” Johnson said in 2022. In 2022, Johnsonintroduceda bill that some described as a national version of what critics callFlorida’s “Don’t Say Gay” bill. The billnever madeit out of committee. For Johnson and those who share his worldview, such policies have spiritual implications not only for individuals but the entire nation, said Philip Gorski, a professor and chair of the sociology department at Yale University who has studied Christian nationalism. “There is much more at stake for Johnson and others who crome from that conservative Christian subculture,” he said. “There is this view the United States is a Christian nation which has entered into a sacred covenant with God that involves upholding certain standards of Christian morality, and when those standards are violated, when those precepts are broken, it threatens the entire country with divine wrath and all kinds of decline.” Following Trump’s 2020 reelection defeat, Johnson played a pivotal role in efforts to overturn the election –urging his colleaguesto sign onto the Texas Attorney General’s longshot lawsuit aiming to throw out the results in key swing states. “It was rejected by a bipartisan majority of the Supreme Court,” Eisen told News Agency, but Johnson was willing to  “perpetuate the loser as the winner and to twist the law and the facts to support that.” Johnson also endorsed some fringe conspiracies, including the unsubstantiated belief that voting software machines were manipulated. On January 6, 2021, Johnson voted to object the election results,later sayinghe was doing his “duty to uphold the Constitution.” For Johnson, the vote to keep Trump in office reflected a striking evolution from his past critique of Trumpin 2015, whom, as first reported by the New York Times, he openly labeled as “dangerous,” lacking “character,” and devoid of a “moral center.” It was the apex of the transactional relationship between the religious right and former TV star. Duringa church service in 2022, reflecting on the conclusion of Roe v. Wade, Johnson remarked that much of the credit belonged to Trump. “There is a lot of credit to go around, but you have to acknowledge, Donald Trump for all of his, peccadillos, okay? Bless him,” Johnson said. “He was true to his word.”",,CNN,43865.0,1927

On a conservative talk radio show the day the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade in June 2022, Johnson underscored Justice Clarence Thomas’s concurring opinion that the high court should reconsider those other landmark rulings. Johnson, citing his years as an attorney against “activist courts,” defended Thomas’ view, insisting that what Thomas was calling for was, “not radical. In fact, it’s the opposite of that.” “There’s been some really bad law made,” hesaid.“They’ve made a mess of our jurisprudence in this country for the last several decades. And maybe some of that needs to be cleaned up.” When asked about Johnson’s post-Roe comments, a spokesman for the congressman told News Agency that Johnson “views the cases as settled law.” Still, News Agency’s review of more than 100 of Johnson’s interviews, speeches and public commentary spanning his decades-long career as a lawmaker and attorney paints a picture of his governing ideals: Imprisoning doctorswho performabortions after six weeks; the Ten Commandmentsprominently displayedin public buildings; aneliminationof anti-hate-crime laws;Bible studyin public schools. Fromendorsinghard labor prison sentences for abortion providers to supporting thecriminalizationof gay sex, his staunchly conservative rhetoric is rooted in an era of “biblical morality,” thathe sayswas washed away with the counterculture in the 1960s. House Speaker Johnson meets with Trump at Mar-a-Lago “One of the primary purposes of the law in civil government is to restrain evil,” Johnson said on one radio showin 2010. “We have to acknowledge collectively that man is inherently evil and needs to be restrained.” His vision has been well received as a congressman in his deeply conservative district in western Louisiana. But his surprising rise to the speakership has brought his particularly subtle brand of fire-and-brimstone to second in line to the presidency — delivering him a national platform from which to shape and influence laws. Johnson’s endorsement of Thomas’ opinion, legal experts say, positioned him significantly outside the mainstream. “Speaker Johnson embraces a view that is not only outside of the mainstream but is so radical in terms of his endorsement of the Thomas position, that even the extremely conservative Supreme Court majority isn’t willing to go there,” said Norm Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute and a News Agency legal analyst. “It would take the country back more than a half-century.” News Agency unearthed more than two dozen radio interviews from Johnson’s time as an attorney at the socially conservative legal advocacy group Alliance Defense Fund (ADF) where Johnson litigated and voiced support for what he sometimes described as a battle for the country between the forces of good and evil. “The arrows in the culture war are particularly directed at our youth, where the Enemy often has the greatest effect,” read the2005webpage for “God & Country,” a Christian local radio show co-hosted by Johnson. “We cannot lose our children to the forces of darkness. Be aware and get active in your kids’ schools.” Topics discussedon the show included “creation science” in public schools; how to “fight the porn industry”; God’s “design for government”; and “the true meaning of ‘separation of church and state.’” As an attorney at ADF, Johnson repeatedly battled two organizations in his fight to keep religion in the public square: The American Civil Liberties Union, which hecalled“the most dangerous organization in America,” and Americans United for Separation of Church and State. The groups clashed over prayer in public schools, public displays of nativity scenes and the right to open public meetings with prayer. “They have convinced an entire generation of Americans that there’s this so-called separation of church and state,”Johnson saidin 2008 about the ACLU. Johnson’s rhetoric has tapped into a “persecution complex” for evangelicals as American culture leans increasingly left on social issues, said Ryan Burge, a political scientist at Eastern Illinois University and a Baptist pastor. “They want to feel embattled. They want to fight the culture war,” Burge told News Agency. “When he talks about Griswold and Lawrence, evangelicals know that what he really is saying to them is: ‘Our way of life is under attack and liberalism is on the march. Stand firm in our convictions,’” added Burge, referring to the landmark cases that legalized gay sex and contraception use. Johnson served not only as an attorney at ADF but a national spokesman for the organization, making appearances on radio and national television where he oftenaddressedso-called “right of conscience” cases involving Christian businesses. Discussingone casein New Mexico, where a wedding photography company was found in violation of the state’s anti-discrimination laws for refusing to photograph a same-sex couple’s commitment ceremony, Johnson argued anti-discrimination laws did not recognize a “behavior” like homosexuality. “There are laws on the books that prohibit discrimination against people for their immutable characteristics, their race and creed and that kind of thing,”Johnsonsaid in a 2009 radio interview. “There’s a difference – and the law has recognized a difference – between that and homosexual behavior. As something that you do, not an immutable characteristic of what you are.” The New Mexico Supreme Court disagreed and ruled against the company, which ADF represented. The Supreme Courtdeclinedto hear the case. Johnson “doesn’t understand the problem with a government compelling its citizens to follow not just religion, but a particular religion,” said Katherine Lewis Parker, the former legal director for the ACLU of North Carolina, who opposed Johnson in a lawsuit related to prayer at official meetings. In that 2007 suit, three residents in Forsyth County, North Carolina, argued local officials had an unconstitutional “practice of sponsoring sectarian prayer” with specific references to Jesus during meetings. Johnson defended the officials and argued that even in Congress, prayers often contain Christian references, which he called a “logical function of the nation’s demographics.” During a deposition, Johnson peppered one of the plaintiffs about what type of prayer would be acceptable in county meetings. “So if someone might be offended by virtually any prayer, should we just get rid of prayer entirely?” he asked. I think he is a true believer and I think he wants to blend religion and government. Kathleen Lewis Parker, former legal director for the ACLU of North Carolina An appeals court ruled against Johnson’s arguments in 2011, though the Supreme Court laterruledin favor of allowing such prayers in a separate case. “I think he is a true believer and I think he wants to blend religion and government,” Parker said of Johnson. Homosexuality was afrequent topicfor Johnson, which he has called “inherently unnatural” and a “dangerous lifestyle.” In addition to suggesting he hopes the Supreme Court will reverse its decision allowing same-sex marriage, he alsowrotein support of Texas’ anti-sodomy laws, which said gay men caught having sex could be fined. “It recognized a fundamental right, a constitutional right to, to sodomy, which had never been recognized before,” Johnson said at a forum in2005on the Supreme Court’s ruling in Lawrence v. Texas — which struck down the ban on gay sex in that state. Johnson supported an Arkansaslawagainst same-sex couples adopting children, citing it as “good public policy” in 2008.

For Johnson and those who share his worldview, such policies have spiritual implications not only for individuals but the entire nation, said Philip Gorski, a professor and chair of the sociology department at Yale University who has studied Christian nationalism. “There is much more at stake for Johnson and others who crome from that conservative Christian subculture,” he said. “There is this view the United States is a Christian nation which has entered into a sacred covenant with God that involves upholding certain standards of Christian morality, and when those standards are violated, when those precepts are broken, it threatens the entire country with divine wrath and all kinds of decline.” Following Trump’s 2020 reelection defeat, Johnson played a pivotal role in efforts to overturn the election –urging his colleaguesto sign onto the Texas Attorney General’s longshot lawsuit aiming to throw out the results in key swing states. “It was rejected by a bipartisan majority of the Supreme Court,” Eisen told News Agency, but Johnson was willing to  “perpetuate the loser as the winner and to twist the law and the facts to support that.” Johnson also endorsed some fringe conspiracies, including the unsubstantiated belief that voting software machines were manipulated. On January 6, 2021, Johnson voted to object the election results,later sayinghe was doing his “duty to uphold the Constitution.” For Johnson, the vote to keep Trump in office reflected a striking evolution from his past critique of Trumpin 2015, whom, as first reported by the New York Times, he openly labeled as “dangerous,” lacking “character,” and devoid of a “moral center.” It was the apex of the transactional relationship between the religious right and former TV star. Duringa church service in 2022, reflecting on the conclusion of Roe v. Wade, Johnson remarked that much of the credit belonged to Trump. “There is a lot of credit to go around, but you have to acknowledge, Donald Trump for all of his, peccadillos, okay? Bless him,” Johnson said. “He was true to his word.”",,CNN,43865.0,1927

The European Union has revamped efforts to pressure international suppliers ahead of the summit.

Key gas suppliers such as the US and Russia are likely to be most affected by the law when it gets final approval from the European Parliament and EU countries. The deal obliges oil and gas producers in the bloc to regularly check for and fix leaks of the potent greenhouse gas in their operations. It also bans most cases of flaring and venting, when companies intentionally burn off or release unwanted methane into the atmosphere, from 2025 or 2027 depending on the type of infrastructure.

While Ivanka Trump isno longer a defendantin Attorney General Letitia James’ case after an appellate court removed her as a defendant earlier this year, she is still likely to be pressed about her role securing financing for properties when she worked at the Trump Organization, as well as the valuation of an apartment she leased in one of her father’s Manhattan buildings. Her testimony comes after her father’s Monday appearance on the witness stand, in which the former president badgered the judge and the attorney general with political attacks that frequentlyirked Judge Arthur Engoron. Takeaways from Donald Trump’s contentious testimony in his civil fraud trial There may not be as many fireworks with Ivanka Trump’s appearance Wednesday, but there has been plenty of drama surrounding her testimony. She had filed a motion to quash the subpoena requiring her testimony, but Engoron ruled she was required to testify. An appellate court denied her motion for a stay, despite her saying it would bedifficult to appear during a school week. Ivanka Trump’s brothers, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., who are co-defendants in the case, testified last week. Here’s what to watch for during her testimony: Ivanka Trump is knowledgeable about allegations included in the civil fraud trial, where the attorney general is seeking $250 million in damages and to bar Trump from doing business in the state. She worked at the Trump Organization as an executive before moving to the White House as a senior aide along with her husband, Jared Kushner, in 2017. The initial lawsuit filed by the attorney general last September pointed to Ivanka Trump’s involvement in securing a loan for purchasing Trump’s Doral golf course in Florida and Chicago properties in 2012, which the attorney general alleges were extended in part because of Trump’s personal financial statements that inflated his assets. “On each of those transactions with Deutsche Bank, Ms. Trump was aware that the transactions included a personal guaranty from Mr. Trump that required him to provide annual Statements of Financial Condition and certifications,” the complaint states. Trump was asked Monday to verify that he signed those loan agreements and he understood they included clauses requiring a minimum net worth and annual financial statements. Ivanka was also involved in the bidding on the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, which Trump converted to a hotel before selling the property last year. “Mr. Trump and Ivanka Trump participated personally in the bidding process in 2011,” the attorney general’s office wrote. “In particular, Ivanka Trump was involved in crafting communications to the GSA in connection with the bid and in responding to deficiency comments raised by the GSA.” Engoron ruled before the start of the trial that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud. The judge is now considering how much the Trumps will have to pay in damages for the profits they’ve allegedly garnered through fraudulent business practices. The attorney general is also seeking to prove additional claims, including falsifying business records, issuing false financial statements and insurance fraud. Last year in a deposition related to this investigation, Ivanka Trump distanced herself from the financial statements, saying she knew the companies had financial statements but that she had no “specific” recollection that her father had personal statements of financial condition. “Sure he has accountants who have all sorts of stuff who have all sorts of statement but no, sorry, I don’t specifically know what was prepared on his behalf for him as a person separate and distinct from the organization and the properties that I was working on so no, I don’t know how they did that and who prepared that and the mechanisms like that,” she testified. Asked whether as a graduate of the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania if she knew that financial statements list all the assets of liabilities and accurately portray entitles’ financial condition, she said, “I’ve never prepared one. I don’t know. I’ve never made one. I’m not an accountant.” While she will be asked questions about her role at the Trump Organization, she is no longer part of the case thanks to anappellate court rulingin June. The court order dismissed the claims against Ivanka Trump after finding that she was not a party to an August 2021 agreement between James’ office and the Trump Organization to toll the statute of limitations. “The record before us…indicates that defendant Ivanka Trump was no longer within the agreement’s definition of ‘Trump Organization’ by the date the tolling agreement was executed,” the order states. “The allegations against defendant Ivanka Trump do not support any claims that accrued after February 6, 2016. Thus, all claims against her should have been dismissed as untimely.” Trump and his attorneys have argued that claims against the former president should also be dismissed because of the statute of limitations, but Engoron has dismissed those claims. Ivanka Trump tried to use the appellate court’s ruling to prevent her testimony in the case. Her attorney, Bennet Moskowitz, argued she was no longer a New York resident and had not worked in the state since 2017, so the court did not have jurisdiction over her. Trump’s attorneys said the subpoena for Ivanka’s testimony was “continued harassment of President Trump’s children.” “They want her in the courtroom so it can be filled with media, and we can have another circus day,” attorney Chris Kise said. Another issue Ivanka Trump is likely to get questions about is a Penthouse apartment in Trump Park Avenue that she leased. According to the attorney general’s complaint, her rental agreement included an option to purchase the unit for $8.5 million. But in Trump’s 2011 and 2012 statements of financial condition, the unit was valued at $20.8 million. In 2013, it was valued at $25 million.

While Ivanka Trump isno longer a defendantin Attorney General Letitia James’ case after an appellate court removed her as a defendant earlier this year, she is still likely to be pressed about her role securing financing for properties when she worked at the Trump Organization, as well as the valuation of an apartment she leased in one of her father’s Manhattan buildings. Her testimony comes after her father’s Monday appearance on the witness stand, in which the former president badgered the judge and the attorney general with political attacks that frequentlyirked Judge Arthur Engoron. Takeaways from Donald Trump’s contentious testimony in his civil fraud trial There may not be as many fireworks with Ivanka Trump’s appearance Wednesday, but there has been plenty of drama surrounding her testimony. She had filed a motion to quash the subpoena requiring her testimony, but Engoron ruled she was required to testify. An appellate court denied her motion for a stay, despite her saying it would bedifficult to appear during a school week. Ivanka Trump’s brothers, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., who are co-defendants in the case, testified last week. Here’s what to watch for during her testimony: Ivanka Trump is knowledgeable about allegations included in the civil fraud trial, where the attorney general is seeking $250 million in damages and to bar Trump from doing business in the state. She worked at the Trump Organization as an executive before moving to the White House as a senior aide along with her husband, Jared Kushner, in 2017. The initial lawsuit filed by the attorney general last September pointed to Ivanka Trump’s involvement in securing a loan for purchasing Trump’s Doral golf course in Florida and Chicago properties in 2012, which the attorney general alleges were extended in part because of Trump’s personal financial statements that inflated his assets. “On each of those transactions with Deutsche Bank, Ms. Trump was aware that the transactions included a personal guaranty from Mr. Trump that required him to provide annual Statements of Financial Condition and certifications,” the complaint states. Trump was asked Monday to verify that he signed those loan agreements and he understood they included clauses requiring a minimum net worth and annual financial statements. Ivanka was also involved in the bidding on the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, which Trump converted to a hotel before selling the property last year. “Mr. Trump and Ivanka Trump participated personally in the bidding process in 2011,” the attorney general’s office wrote. “In particular, Ivanka Trump was involved in crafting communications to the GSA in connection with the bid and in responding to deficiency comments raised by the GSA.” Engoron ruled before the start of the trial that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud. The judge is now considering how much the Trumps will have to pay in damages for the profits they’ve allegedly garnered through fraudulent business practices. The attorney general is also seeking to prove additional claims, including falsifying business records, issuing false financial statements and insurance fraud. Last year in a deposition related to this investigation, Ivanka Trump distanced herself from the financial statements, saying she knew the companies had financial statements but that she had no “specific” recollection that her father had personal statements of financial condition. “Sure he has accountants who have all sorts of stuff who have all sorts of statement but no, sorry, I don’t specifically know what was prepared on his behalf for him as a person separate and distinct from the organization and the properties that I was working on so no, I don’t know how they did that and who prepared that and the mechanisms like that,” she testified. Asked whether as a graduate of the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania if she knew that financial statements list all the assets of liabilities and accurately portray entitles’ financial condition, she said, “I’ve never prepared one. I don’t know. I’ve never made one. I’m not an accountant.” While she will be asked questions about her role at the Trump Organization, she is no longer part of the case thanks to anappellate court rulingin June. The court order dismissed the claims against Ivanka Trump after finding that she was not a party to an August 2021 agreement between James’ office and the Trump Organization to toll the statute of limitations. “The record before us…indicates that defendant Ivanka Trump was no longer within the agreement’s definition of ‘Trump Organization’ by the date the tolling agreement was executed,” the order states. “The allegations against defendant Ivanka Trump do not support any claims that accrued after February 6, 2016. Thus, all claims against her should have been dismissed as untimely.” Trump and his attorneys have argued that claims against the former president should also be dismissed because of the statute of limitations, but Engoron has dismissed those claims. Ivanka Trump tried to use the appellate court’s ruling to prevent her testimony in the case. Her attorney, Bennet Moskowitz, argued she was no longer a New York resident and had not worked in the state since 2017, so the court did not have jurisdiction over her. Trump’s attorneys said the subpoena for Ivanka’s testimony was “continued harassment of President Trump’s children.” “They want her in the courtroom so it can be filled with media, and we can have another circus day,” attorney Chris Kise said. Another issue Ivanka Trump is likely to get questions about is a Penthouse apartment in Trump Park Avenue that she leased. According to the attorney general’s complaint, her rental agreement included an option to purchase the unit for $8.5 million. But in Trump’s 2011 and 2012 statements of financial condition, the unit was valued at $20.8 million. In 2013, it was valued at $25 million. The complaint also alleged that she was given an option in 2014 to purchase a different, larger penthouse unit in the building for $14.3 million – but the unit was listed in the 2014 statement of financial condition for $45 million. “In that year, Ms. Trump’s option to purchase the unit at a steep discount was included in a lease in which she was charged a rental payment substantially below the market rent for similar units in the same building,” the complaint states.

But for how long?,"Far-right members of the Republican caucus have opposed the bipartisan budget bill, which averted a government shutdown. With just over a day to spare, the United States averted yet another government shutdown on Thursday night, as President Joe Biden signed a last-minute bill to keep federal agencies funded through the new year. The bill was hailed as a bipartisan success — and as a key victory for newly minted House SpeakerMike Johnson, who was elected to the role only three weeks ago. But analysts say this short-term win might spell long-term trouble for Johnson, as he leads a fractured Republican caucus in the House of Representatives. “Some people believe that Johnson’s success in passing the continuing resolution indicates that the far right in the GOP will go along with the new speaker,” said Richard F Bensel, a government professor at Cornell University. “I read the event differently, because Johnson has deeply offended those far-right members, and they will now make life very difficult for him and the rest of the Republican Party.” Government spendingis a perennially divisive issue in the US Congress, with many Republicans pushing for greater budget cuts and Democrats often seeking to protect or expand social programmes. But when the two parties fail to pass budget legislation, the government risks shuttering all its non-essential functions. That leaves government services in limbo and employees and contractors without pay, potentially harming the country’s overall economic growth. Republicans and Democrats had set November 17 as their next deadline to pass new funding legislation. Faced with the prospect of an imminent shutdown, Johnson offered an unusual proposal: a two-step stopgap bill — or “continuing resolution” — that would allow government services to continue temporarily at current spending levels. But the catch was that Congress would have to revisit the budget question twice in the new year. Funding for veterans services, housing, agriculture and energy would need to be voted on before January 19, and the remainder of the budget would have to be decided by February 2. Nevertheless, Johnson’s bill proved to be a successful compromise. Itpassed the Houseon Tuesday with a vote of 336 to 95, thanks to the almost unanimous support from the Democrats. It also sailed through the Democrat-controlled Senate, allowing Biden to sign it into law late on Thursday. Johnson framed the bill’s passage as “a gift to the American people”, sparing the country any economic uncertainty and legislative deadlock. “It’s going to change the way we’ve done this,” Johnson said of his two-step solution. “We have broken the fever.” But the bill failed to wrest major concessions from the Democrats, including the significant budget cuts that the far right had called for. As a result, a total of 93 House Republicans voted against the continuing resolution, breaking ranks with Johnson. “If we were keeping score — and, of course, everyone in Washington does — this is a clear win for the Democrats. Given the divided government, the Democrats would prefer such a continuing resolution all the way to February 2025,” Bensel, the Cornell University professor, said. Among the Republican opposition was a group of about 30 self-proclaimed fiscal conservatives known as theFreedom Caucus. One of the caucus’sleaders, Representative Chip Roy, slammed the bill as a “strategic failure” and “mistake” that Johnson committed “right out of the gate”. “When are we going to do what we said we would do?” Roy asked on the House floor. “When are we going to stand to thwart and stop the reckless spending?” Critics have noted that the Freedom Caucus is often a disruptive presence in Congress, one that considers members of the Democratic Party as “enemies” and “Marxists”. Cooperation, therefore, is not an option. Nicholas F Jacobs, a government professor at Colby College, said that scuttling bills like the budget resolution can actually pay political dividends for members of the Freedom Caucus. “What makes them different is that they do not feel the same electoral pressures when the government shuts down as does every other member of Congress, Republican or Democrat,” Jacobs said. In fact, he added, hardline tactics — even risking a government shutdown — can actually appeal to their far-right base. “They can still score points when they go on Twitter or Fox, claiming they’re doing everything possible to cut the national debt.” Though Johnson may have angered the Freedom Caucus, he retains his reputation as a far-right Republican himself. Jacobs warned that the bipartisan success of Johnson’s funding bill should not be seen as a shift to the centre for either Republicans or Democrats. “I don’t think we can expect to see any pragmatic turn soon,” Jacobs said. “Democrats relish the fact that Republicans can’t govern at the moment.” Bensel likewise cast doubt over whether the bipartisan spending bill signals an embrace of political pragmatism in Congress. Rather, Johnson is seen as part of a continuing shift rightward for the Republican Party. Formerly a little-known representative from Louisiana, Johnson is considered a loyal supporter of formerPresident Donald Trumpand a key figure behind the effort tosubvert the 2020 election, which Trump lost. “On social and cultural issues, Johnson is even more of an abomination for Democrats than is Donald Trump, which will complicate pragmatic politics,” Bensel said. Bensel also noted Johnson’s prominent embrace of the Christian right. In his first interview as speaker, Johnson told TV host Sean Hannity that his worldview was shaped by the Bible. “His evangelical Christian beliefs place him at the fringe of the GOP, a party that is otherwise known for its religious commitments,” Bensel said. “Johnson’s devout beliefs may, in the end, trip him up if he is forced to choose between them and more pragmatic politics.” Regardless of Johnson’s political and religious leanings, Bensel questions whether any Republican speaker can keep ahold of the gavel in thebitterly divided House. Just a month and a half ago, on October 3, far-right members of the party led asuccessful effortto overthrow Johnson’s predecessor,former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, after he also agreed to a bipartisan budget compromise. McCarthy had only been speaker for nine months. “It may be that no Republican can survive very long as speaker in the current House,” Bensel said. But Bensel and other analysts acknowledged there were key differences between McCarthy and Johnson that may shape their respective fates as party leaders. Robert Y Shapiro, a government professor at Columbia University, told News Agency that McCarthy was not seen as a stalwart enough supporter of the far right. “He was not enough of a backer of all matters related to Trump and vigorously denying the election,” Shapiro explained. “He was not a visible backer of the Freedom Caucus and right-wing rhetoric and craziness, and was seen as more willing to work with Democrats.” He added that Johnson’s dark-horse status as a speaker candidate proved to be an advantage. “Johnson, meanwhile, was not well known, so without McCarthy’s baggage, and he has been a strong supporter of Trump — and a fellow election denier,” Shapiro said. McCarthy’s removal as speaker in October triggered aprolonged searchfor a replacement, one that shone a spotlight on the disarray in the Republican Party. It took three weeks of party in-fighting and multiple votes for Johnson toemerge victorious.

But for how long?,"Far-right members of the Republican caucus have opposed the bipartisan budget bill, which averted a government shutdown. With just over a day to spare, the United States averted yet another government shutdown on Thursday night, as President Joe Biden signed a last-minute bill to keep federal agencies funded through the new year. The bill was hailed as a bipartisan success — and as a key victory for newly minted House SpeakerMike Johnson, who was elected to the role only three weeks ago. But analysts say this short-term win might spell long-term trouble for Johnson, as he leads a fractured Republican caucus in the House of Representatives. “Some people believe that Johnson’s success in passing the continuing resolution indicates that the far right in the GOP will go along with the new speaker,” said Richard F Bensel, a government professor at Cornell University. “I read the event differently, because Johnson has deeply offended those far-right members, and they will now make life very difficult for him and the rest of the Republican Party.” Government spendingis a perennially divisive issue in the US Congress, with many Republicans pushing for greater budget cuts and Democrats often seeking to protect or expand social programmes. But when the two parties fail to pass budget legislation, the government risks shuttering all its non-essential functions. That leaves government services in limbo and employees and contractors without pay, potentially harming the country’s overall economic growth. Republicans and Democrats had set November 17 as their next deadline to pass new funding legislation. Faced with the prospect of an imminent shutdown, Johnson offered an unusual proposal: a two-step stopgap bill — or “continuing resolution” — that would allow government services to continue temporarily at current spending levels. But the catch was that Congress would have to revisit the budget question twice in the new year. Funding for veterans services, housing, agriculture and energy would need to be voted on before January 19, and the remainder of the budget would have to be decided by February 2. Nevertheless, Johnson’s bill proved to be a successful compromise. Itpassed the Houseon Tuesday with a vote of 336 to 95, thanks to the almost unanimous support from the Democrats. It also sailed through the Democrat-controlled Senate, allowing Biden to sign it into law late on Thursday. Johnson framed the bill’s passage as “a gift to the American people”, sparing the country any economic uncertainty and legislative deadlock. “It’s going to change the way we’ve done this,” Johnson said of his two-step solution. “We have broken the fever.” But the bill failed to wrest major concessions from the Democrats, including the significant budget cuts that the far right had called for. As a result, a total of 93 House Republicans voted against the continuing resolution, breaking ranks with Johnson. “If we were keeping score — and, of course, everyone in Washington does — this is a clear win for the Democrats. Given the divided government, the Democrats would prefer such a continuing resolution all the way to February 2025,” Bensel, the Cornell University professor, said. Among the Republican opposition was a group of about 30 self-proclaimed fiscal conservatives known as theFreedom Caucus. One of the caucus’sleaders, Representative Chip Roy, slammed the bill as a “strategic failure” and “mistake” that Johnson committed “right out of the gate”. “When are we going to do what we said we would do?” Roy asked on the House floor. “When are we going to stand to thwart and stop the reckless spending?” Critics have noted that the Freedom Caucus is often a disruptive presence in Congress, one that considers members of the Democratic Party as “enemies” and “Marxists”. Cooperation, therefore, is not an option. Nicholas F Jacobs, a government professor at Colby College, said that scuttling bills like the budget resolution can actually pay political dividends for members of the Freedom Caucus. “What makes them different is that they do not feel the same electoral pressures when the government shuts down as does every other member of Congress, Republican or Democrat,” Jacobs said. In fact, he added, hardline tactics — even risking a government shutdown — can actually appeal to their far-right base. “They can still score points when they go on Twitter or Fox, claiming they’re doing everything possible to cut the national debt.” Though Johnson may have angered the Freedom Caucus, he retains his reputation as a far-right Republican himself. Jacobs warned that the bipartisan success of Johnson’s funding bill should not be seen as a shift to the centre for either Republicans or Democrats. “I don’t think we can expect to see any pragmatic turn soon,” Jacobs said. “Democrats relish the fact that Republicans can’t govern at the moment.” Bensel likewise cast doubt over whether the bipartisan spending bill signals an embrace of political pragmatism in Congress. Rather, Johnson is seen as part of a continuing shift rightward for the Republican Party. Formerly a little-known representative from Louisiana, Johnson is considered a loyal supporter of formerPresident Donald Trumpand a key figure behind the effort tosubvert the 2020 election, which Trump lost. “On social and cultural issues, Johnson is even more of an abomination for Democrats than is Donald Trump, which will complicate pragmatic politics,” Bensel said. Bensel also noted Johnson’s prominent embrace of the Christian right. In his first interview as speaker, Johnson told TV host Sean Hannity that his worldview was shaped by the Bible. “His evangelical Christian beliefs place him at the fringe of the GOP, a party that is otherwise known for its religious commitments,” Bensel said. “Johnson’s devout beliefs may, in the end, trip him up if he is forced to choose between them and more pragmatic politics.” Regardless of Johnson’s political and religious leanings, Bensel questions whether any Republican speaker can keep ahold of the gavel in thebitterly divided House. Just a month and a half ago, on October 3, far-right members of the party led asuccessful effortto overthrow Johnson’s predecessor,former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, after he also agreed to a bipartisan budget compromise. McCarthy had only been speaker for nine months. “It may be that no Republican can survive very long as speaker in the current House,” Bensel said. But Bensel and other analysts acknowledged there were key differences between McCarthy and Johnson that may shape their respective fates as party leaders. Robert Y Shapiro, a government professor at Columbia University, told News Agency that McCarthy was not seen as a stalwart enough supporter of the far right. “He was not enough of a backer of all matters related to Trump and vigorously denying the election,” Shapiro explained. “He was not a visible backer of the Freedom Caucus and right-wing rhetoric and craziness, and was seen as more willing to work with Democrats.” He added that Johnson’s dark-horse status as a speaker candidate proved to be an advantage. “Johnson, meanwhile, was not well known, so without McCarthy’s baggage, and he has been a strong supporter of Trump — and a fellow election denier,” Shapiro said. McCarthy’s removal as speaker in October triggered aprolonged searchfor a replacement, one that shone a spotlight on the disarray in the Republican Party. It took three weeks of party in-fighting and multiple votes for Johnson toemerge victorious. Shapiro said the Republicans are likely looking to project an image of stability moving forward — and that will help protect Johnson’s position as speaker, at least over the short term. “They also will not boot him since Republicans in the House realise how bad booting him and another battle for Speaker would look,” he said.

Green hydrogen refers to hydrogen produced from renewable energy sources such as wind energy and light energy. It is regarded as one of the clean energy sources with the greatest development potential. Inner Mongolia is rich in wind and light resources and has unique advantages in developing green hydrogen. How to more efficiently and conveniently transport green hydrogen from Inner Mongolia and even western my country to areas with strong market demand in the east has always been a bottleneck restricting the development of the green hydrogen industry.

After the pipeline is completed, it will be used to replace the existing fossil energy hydrogen production in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, greatly alleviate the problem of mismatch between green hydrogen supply and demand in my country, and play a strategic demonstration and leading role in the future construction of my country's cross-regional hydrogen transmission pipeline network, assisting my countrys energy transformation and upgrading. ""The first phase of the pipeline has a transportation capacity of 100,000 tons/year, with a long-term improvement potential of 500,000 tons/year reserved. At the same time, ports will be reserved at many places along the line to facilitate access to potential hydrogen sources."" Ma Yongsheng said that in the future, Sinopec It can rely on the construction of branch lines and hydrogenation mother stations of the ""West-to-East Hydrogen Transmission"" pipeline to help build the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei hydrogen energy corridor and help achieve the ""double carbon"" goal in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Ma Yongsheng said that this project will provide a demonstration solution for the cross-provincial and municipal application of green hydrogen in western my country. Green hydrogen refers to hydrogen produced from renewable energy sources such as wind energy and light energy. It is regarded as one of the clean energy sources with the greatest development potential. Inner Mongolia is rich in wind and light resources and has unique advantages in developing green hydrogen. How to more efficiently and conveniently transport green hydrogen from Inner Mongolia and even western my country to areas with strong market demand in the east has always been a bottleneck restricting the development of the green hydrogen industry. ""Hydrogen transmission pipelines can transport hydrogen on a large scale and over long distances while taking into account economics. Sinopec has deployed the Ordos scenery-solar integrated green hydrogen demonstration project in Inner Mongolia and plans to build large-scale green power to produce green hydrogen in Ulanqab City Project.""

A reporter asked: According to reports, on the 20th, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said during an on-site inspection of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant that in order to promote the decommissioning of nuclear reactors and the reconstruction of Fukushima, the discharge of ""nuclear treatment water"" is an issue that must not be delayed. The report also stated that the Japanese government has basically decided to hold a cabinet meeting on the 22nd to finalize the specific date for starting the discharge of nuclear-contaminated water into the sea. what opinions do the Chinese have on this issue? Wang Wenbin: China has repeatedly stated its solemn position on the Japanese governments plan to discharge Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water into the sea. The Japanese government ignores domestic and foreign opposition calls, disregards the international community's doubts about the legitimacy, legality, and safety of the sea discharge plan, and ignores the risks of the sea discharge plan harming the global marine environment and human health, and insists on advancing the plan to discharge nuclear contaminated water into the sea. , is extremely selfish and irresponsible. China expresses serious concern about this and will pay close attention to the development of the situation. The Japanese government's forced plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water into the sea is a serious breach of trust. In 2015, the Japanese government solemnly promised in a written document to the Fukushima Prefecture Fisheries Federation that it would not take any disposal measures for nuclear-contaminated water without the understanding of stakeholders. To this day, a large number of Japanese people, including the Fukushima Prefecture Fisheries Organization, still strongly oppose the decision to discharge the sea. The latest Kyodo News poll on the 20th showed that 88.1% of the respondents were worried that the sea discharge plan would damage Japan's image and potential economic interests, and 81.9% of the respondents believed that the Japanese government's explanation was insufficient. The Japanese government downplayed it on the 20th and stated that sea discharge is a long-term matter and that fishermens concerns must be addressed from a long-term perspective. The Japanese government's behavior of breaking its promises and going back on its word has broken the trust of the domestic people and the international community. Once nuclear-contaminated water is discharged into the sea, it will be ""overwhelmed and difficult to recover."" China urges the Japanese government to face up to the legitimate and reasonable concerns of the domestic people and the international community, not to make wrong decisions, and to stop pushing forward the plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water into the sea.

We cannot blame the sea, not at all. Paying close attention to marine environmental issues Zhou Enlai paid close attention to the pollution of rivers, lakes and seas caused by the industrial development of developed countries such as the United States and Japan, and asked our country to pay attention to this issue as early as possible in industrial development. In the early 1970s, Zhou Enlai repeatedly talked about the problem of river, lake and ocean pollution in the United States. On June 21, 1970, he inquired in detail about the aquatic product output and aquatic product varieties of the United States, the Soviet Union, Peru, the Netherlands, Norway, the United Kingdom and other countries. When he learned that U.S. aquatic product production had dropped from 2.5 million tons in 1966 to 1.98 million tons, he asked: ""Why? Is it caused by industrial sewage?"" Oil tankers and ships carrying nuclear weapons can easily pollute seawater. To this end, Canada stipulates that no ships that pollute seawater are allowed to pass within 100 nautical miles of the North Sea territorial waters starting from the Arctic Ocean. Zhou Enlai supported Canada's regulations and said that this problem occurs throughout the Americas. This problem will also be mentioned in the Mediterranean coastal countries, Asian countries, and African countries. Zhou Enlai also condemned nuclear testing in the ocean, dumping garbage into the ocean, and electroshock fishing, etc., as criminal acts for the sake of hegemony and making money regardless of the consequences. In Japan in the late 1950s, water pollution incidents continued to occur. In the late 1960s, water pollution in Japan intensified and became a major public hazard to society. Lake Biwa, located near Osaka and Kyoto prefectures in central Honshu, was also polluted. Zhou Enlai was very concerned about water pollution in Japan, China's close neighbor. On December 6, 1970, he told Japanese guests: What is the ""pollution hazard"" situation in Japan under the conditions of great industrial development? Which ""public hazard"" is the most serious? Is it sewage, waste gas or garbage? Two days later, on December 8, Zhou Enlai met with Japanese friendly people such as Masahisa Suganuma. When he learned that pond mud in Japan could not be used as fertilizer due to pollution, he said: It was polluted by wastewater and sewage from factories. ""Public hazard"" wastewater and sewage invade the human body, making people unhealthy. On February 15, 1971, he said that ""pollution"" has become a major problem in the world. Waste gas, waste water, and waste residue are very harmful to the United States. Lake Biwa, the largest in Japan, is polluted. There are no fish in the offshore waters, so fishing has to be done offshore. Zhou Enlai attached great importance to the prevention and control of water source pollution. He criticized the pollution and damage that developed capitalist countries have brought to rivers, oceans and even the entire earth in the process of modernization, and pointed out that China must learn from the lessons of the West in its development towards industrialization and modernization, and must not follow the path of pollution first and governance later. . In October 1972, when discussing the report of the Conference on the Human Environment in the Second Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, representatives from developing countries condemned the destruction of the human environment by Western developed countries. In stark contrast to Western developed countries, on January 30, 1974, the State Council of China approved the report of the Ministry of Transport on the ""Interim Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Prevention of Coastal Water Pollution"", requiring the Ministry of Transport and the State Oceanic Administration to work with relevant departments and regions Organization and implementation. Emphasizing that the design and construction of nuclear power plants must be absolutely safe and reliable. From the perspective of protecting the health of all mankind, Zhou Enlai strongly criticized some countries for conducting multiple nuclear tests in the atmosphere. He was also concerned about the adverse impact of exhaust gas, waste water and waste emitted by nuclear submarines and nuclear power plants on human beings, and proposed that the principle of not polluting the land and not harming the people must be followed. On July 15 and 16, 1970, Zhou Enlai pointed out when listening to the report at the Central Special Committee meeting: What should we do with the wastewater and smoke from nuclear submarines in the sea? It is best not to allow the marine environment to be affected. Zhou Enlai required attention to the treatment of wastewater, waste gas, and waste during the design and construction of the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant project. On December 15, 1970, Zhou Enlai pointed out when listening to the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant project report at the Central Special Committee meeting: If we try to absorb all the wastewater, wouldn't it be toxic if it evaporates into the air? If burned, the gas will escape, but it still needs to be recycled. Exhaust gas is a bigger problem. Emphasize that we cannot blame the sea, not at all. On March 31, 1974, Zhou Enlai chaired a meeting of the Central Special Committee and once again listened to a report on the technical status of the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant project. When talking about the safety issues of nuclear power plants, he emphasized that the design and construction of nuclear power plants must be absolutely safe and reliable, especially the treatment of radioactive wastewater, waste gas, and waste must be considered in the long term. We must adhere to the principle of not polluting the land and not harming the people. We should attach great importance to environmental protection with a great sense of urgency. Zhou Enlai paid great attention to learning and drawing on foreign experience in environmental protection work. He made it clear that we should see our own problems and pay attention to learning from foreign countries. On October 25, 1971, the 26th United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution restoring all legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai approved the formation of the Chinese delegation to attend the UN General Assembly, and Xiong Xianghui was appointed as one of the representatives. Before leaving, Zhou Enlai asked Xiong Xianghui to take a camera to understand the environmental protection situation in the United States. While in New York, Xiong Xianghui edited some materials on major social issues in the United States from the New York Times, translated them after returning to China, and published them under the title ""Silhouette of American Society."" Regarding the environmental protection work in the United States, Zhou Enlai paid most attention to the following two articles: The first article: ""Mississippi River: Pathway of Pollution"" (extract translation), originally published in the New York Times on December 8, 1971. Main content: Americans are destroying their great rivers. But now, the Mississippi River has become a ditch for sewage and poison. It is now so dirty that it is almost impossible to swim or fish in it. The second article: ""It's impossible, the governor said"" (excerpt), originally published in the New York Times on December 10, 1971. Main content: Governor Rockefeller said today that the goal of the Senate-passed bill to stop dumping polluting materials into the nation's waterways by 1985 is ""totally impossible"" to achieve. After reading the above two reports, Zhou Enlai said two words. One sentence is: Never let our Yangtze River become the Mississippi River! Another sentence is: It costs money to control pollution, but money alone cannot control pollution! In October 1972, Zhou Enlai asked scientist Qian Weichang to inspect the environmental protection issues of these countries during his visit to the United Kingdom, Sweden, Canada and the United States with the Chinese scientific delegation. After Qian Weichang visited the four countries, he handed over to Zhou Enlai a 50,000-word report on the environmental protection work of the four countries, and put forward suggestions on my country's environmental protection management and policies. Qian Weichang said in the report that many environmental scholars in the West claim that destroying the natural ecological environment will result in punishment from nature and even national subjugation. This is not alarmist, but a cruel reality. Nowadays, Westerners have paid attention to and worried about the home of the earth, which mankind depends on for survival. This is a home for which mankind has no choice. Westerners began to ask themselves: Does social progress have to come at the expense of destroying their own homes? Qian Weichang called on our country to attach great importance to environmental protection with a great sense of urgency for the sake of future generations and the development of China's economy. In his report, Qian Weichang suggested to Zhou Enlai the establishment of a national environmental protection bureau and environmental protection research institutions. From June 5 to 16, 1972, the first United Nations Conference on the Human Environment was held in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden. With the support of Zhou Enlai, China sent a delegation headed by Tang Ke to attend the meeting. Through this meeting, we learned about the world's environmental status and the significant impact of environmental issues on economic and social development. After the meeting, the delegation came back and reported to Zhou Enlai. He directed that a national conference be convened immediately to study and resolve China's environmental protection issues. This meeting became a turning point in my country's environmental protection cause. ",Mainland China,People's Daily,,2187

We cannot blame the sea, not at all. Paying close attention to marine environmental issues Zhou Enlai paid close attention to the pollution of rivers, lakes and seas caused by the industrial development of developed countries such as the United States and Japan, and asked our country to pay attention to this issue as early as possible in industrial development. In the early 1970s, Zhou Enlai repeatedly talked about the problem of river, lake and ocean pollution in the United States. On June 21, 1970, he inquired in detail about the aquatic product output and aquatic product varieties of the United States, the Soviet Union, Peru, the Netherlands, Norway, the United Kingdom and other countries. When he learned that U.S. aquatic product production had dropped from 2.5 million tons in 1966 to 1.98 million tons, he asked: ""Why? Is it caused by industrial sewage?"" Oil tankers and ships carrying nuclear weapons can easily pollute seawater. To this end, Canada stipulates that no ships that pollute seawater are allowed to pass within 100 nautical miles of the North Sea territorial waters starting from the Arctic Ocean. Zhou Enlai supported Canada's regulations and said that this problem occurs throughout the Americas. This problem will also be mentioned in the Mediterranean coastal countries, Asian countries, and African countries. Zhou Enlai also condemned nuclear testing in the ocean, dumping garbage into the ocean, and electroshock fishing, etc., as criminal acts for the sake of hegemony and making money regardless of the consequences. In Japan in the late 1950s, water pollution incidents continued to occur. In the late 1960s, water pollution in Japan intensified and became a major public hazard to society. Lake Biwa, located near Osaka and Kyoto prefectures in central Honshu, was also polluted. Zhou Enlai was very concerned about water pollution in Japan, China's close neighbor. On December 6, 1970, he told Japanese guests: What is the ""pollution hazard"" situation in Japan under the conditions of great industrial development? Which ""public hazard"" is the most serious? Is it sewage, waste gas or garbage? Two days later, on December 8, Zhou Enlai met with Japanese friendly people such as Masahisa Suganuma. When he learned that pond mud in Japan could not be used as fertilizer due to pollution, he said: It was polluted by wastewater and sewage from factories. ""Public hazard"" wastewater and sewage invade the human body, making people unhealthy. On February 15, 1971, he said that ""pollution"" has become a major problem in the world. Waste gas, waste water, and waste residue are very harmful to the United States. Lake Biwa, the largest in Japan, is polluted. There are no fish in the offshore waters, so fishing has to be done offshore. Zhou Enlai attached great importance to the prevention and control of water source pollution. He criticized the pollution and damage that developed capitalist countries have brought to rivers, oceans and even the entire earth in the process of modernization, and pointed out that China must learn from the lessons of the West in its development towards industrialization and modernization, and must not follow the path of pollution first and governance later. . In October 1972, when discussing the report of the Conference on the Human Environment in the Second Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, representatives from developing countries condemned the destruction of the human environment by Western developed countries. In stark contrast to Western developed countries, on January 30, 1974, the State Council of China approved the report of the Ministry of Transport on the ""Interim Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Prevention of Coastal Water Pollution"", requiring the Ministry of Transport and the State Oceanic Administration to work with relevant departments and regions Organization and implementation. Emphasizing that the design and construction of nuclear power plants must be absolutely safe and reliable. From the perspective of protecting the health of all mankind, Zhou Enlai strongly criticized some countries for conducting multiple nuclear tests in the atmosphere. He was also concerned about the adverse impact of exhaust gas, waste water and waste emitted by nuclear submarines and nuclear power plants on human beings, and proposed that the principle of not polluting the land and not harming the people must be followed. On July 15 and 16, 1970, Zhou Enlai pointed out when listening to the report at the Central Special Committee meeting: What should we do with the wastewater and smoke from nuclear submarines in the sea? It is best not to allow the marine environment to be affected. Zhou Enlai required attention to the treatment of wastewater, waste gas, and waste during the design and construction of the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant project. On December 15, 1970, Zhou Enlai pointed out when listening to the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant project report at the Central Special Committee meeting: If we try to absorb all the wastewater, wouldn't it be toxic if it evaporates into the air? If burned, the gas will escape, but it still needs to be recycled. Exhaust gas is a bigger problem. Emphasize that we cannot blame the sea, not at all. On March 31, 1974, Zhou Enlai chaired a meeting of the Central Special Committee and once again listened to a report on the technical status of the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant project. When talking about the safety issues of nuclear power plants, he emphasized that the design and construction of nuclear power plants must be absolutely safe and reliable, especially the treatment of radioactive wastewater, waste gas, and waste must be considered in the long term. We must adhere to the principle of not polluting the land and not harming the people. We should attach great importance to environmental protection with a great sense of urgency. Zhou Enlai paid great attention to learning and drawing on foreign experience in environmental protection work. He made it clear that we should see our own problems and pay attention to learning from foreign countries. On October 25, 1971, the 26th United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution restoring all legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai approved the formation of the Chinese delegation to attend the UN General Assembly, and Xiong Xianghui was appointed as one of the representatives. Before leaving, Zhou Enlai asked Xiong Xianghui to take a camera to understand the environmental protection situation in the United States. While in New York, Xiong Xianghui edited some materials on major social issues in the United States from the New York Times, translated them after returning to China, and published them under the title ""Silhouette of American Society."" Regarding the environmental protection work in the United States, Zhou Enlai paid most attention to the following two articles: The first article: ""Mississippi River: Pathway of Pollution"" (extract translation), originally published in the New York Times on December 8, 1971. Main content: Americans are destroying their great rivers. But now, the Mississippi River has become a ditch for sewage and poison. It is now so dirty that it is almost impossible to swim or fish in it. The second article: ""It's impossible, the governor said"" (excerpt), originally published in the New York Times on December 10, 1971. Main content: Governor Rockefeller said today that the goal of the Senate-passed bill to stop dumping polluting materials into the nation's waterways by 1985 is ""totally impossible"" to achieve. After reading the above two reports, Zhou Enlai said two words. One sentence is: Never let our Yangtze River become the Mississippi River! Another sentence is: It costs money to control pollution, but money alone cannot control pollution! In October 1972, Zhou Enlai asked scientist Qian Weichang to inspect the environmental protection issues of these countries during his visit to the United Kingdom, Sweden, Canada and the United States with the Chinese scientific delegation. After Qian Weichang visited the four countries, he handed over to Zhou Enlai a 50,000-word report on the environmental protection work of the four countries, and put forward suggestions on my country's environmental protection management and policies. Qian Weichang said in the report that many environmental scholars in the West claim that destroying the natural ecological environment will result in punishment from nature and even national subjugation. This is not alarmist, but a cruel reality. Nowadays, Westerners have paid attention to and worried about the home of the earth, which mankind depends on for survival. This is a home for which mankind has no choice. Westerners began to ask themselves: Does social progress have to come at the expense of destroying their own homes? Qian Weichang called on our country to attach great importance to environmental protection with a great sense of urgency for the sake of future generations and the development of China's economy. In his report, Qian Weichang suggested to Zhou Enlai the establishment of a national environmental protection bureau and environmental protection research institutions. From June 5 to 16, 1972, the first United Nations Conference on the Human Environment was held in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden. With the support of Zhou Enlai, China sent a delegation headed by Tang Ke to attend the meeting. Through this meeting, we learned about the world's environmental status and the significant impact of environmental issues on economic and social development. After the meeting, the delegation came back and reported to Zhou Enlai. He directed that a national conference be convened immediately to study and resolve China's environmental protection issues. This meeting became a turning point in my country's environmental protection cause. ",Mainland China,People's Daily,,2187

To forge ahead on a new journey, we must accelerate the clean and efficient development of energy. Make use of it and do a great job in the green and low-carbon transformation of energy. For example, we must continue to increase the supply of non-fossil energy and accelerate the adjustment and optimization of energy structure.

The proportion of energy consumption increased by 7.8 percentage points to 17.5%. The clean energy industry has formed a global leading advantage. Key components of photovoltaic and wind power account for 70% of the global market share. The energy transformation is advancing in depth. Energy is the main battlefield in promoting carbon peak and carbon neutrality. Only by starting from national conditions, coordinating development and security, insisting on establishing before breaking, making comprehensive plans, and solidly advancing the green and low-carbon transformation of energy can we provide strong support for the active and steady advancement of dual-carbon work. In terms of green development, with the establishment and implementation of dual control systems for total energy consumption and intensity, energy-saving indicators have been included in performance evaluation systems such as ecological civilization and green development, and energy and ecological environmental friendliness have been significantly improved. In terms of transformation momentum, technological innovation plays a key role in energy development, a complete clean energy equipment manufacturing industry chain is established and operational, and a large number of new energy technologies, new models, and new business formats are booming. In terms of policy support, the implementation plan for carbon peaking in the energy, coal, and petroleum fields was issued and implemented, and the market, legal, and standards systems were further improved. The large-scale, high-proportion, and market-oriented development of new energy is gratifying, but at the same time, we must also be clearly aware that the prerequisite for green and low-carbon energy transformation is to ensure energy security. The gradual withdrawal of traditional energy must be based on the safe and reliable replacement of new energy. Although the proportion of installed capacity continues to increase, new energy cannot completely replace coal power in the short term. Not only that, new energy power generation such as wind energy and solar energy has shortcomings such as randomness and volatility; most of these resources are distributed in the ""Three North"" regions, while the electricity load is mainly concentrated in the central, eastern and southern regions, facing problems such as cross-provincial power transmission. In addition, the existing institutional mechanisms, policy systems, and governance methods still face some difficulties and challenges, and are still difficult to adapt to the needs of promoting green and low-carbon energy transformation under the new situation. The more complex the situation, the more we need to anchor our goals and strengthen our confidence. The report of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposed to ""improve the regulation of the total amount and intensity of energy consumption, focus on controlling fossil energy consumption, and gradually shift to a 'dual control' system of total amount and intensity of carbon emissions."" To forge ahead on a new journey, we must accelerate the clean and efficient development of energy. Make use of it and do a great job in the green and low-carbon transformation of energy. For example, we must continue to increase the supply of non-fossil energy and accelerate the adjustment and optimization of energy structure. Another example is to promote the electrification of energy production equipment, promote the integrated development of coal mines, oil and gas fields and new energy, and continue to improve the level of energy conservation and carbon reduction in energy production. Another example is to strengthen green and low-carbon technology innovation and transformation mechanism guarantees, and increase efforts to tackle low-carbon, zero-carbon and negative-carbon technologies, etc. The ""14th Five-Year Plan"" period is a critical period and window period for carbon peak, and the task of energy low-carbon development transformation is more urgent. With ensuring national energy security and economic development as the bottom line, resolutely implement the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and improve the quality of energy supply, utilization efficiency and carbon reduction levels, we will surely be able to further promote the green and low-carbon transformation of energy and contribute to the construction of an energy power. .",Mainland China,People's Daily,,1089

However, after years of development, the potential of monocrystalline silicon has been almost exhausted and has stagnated. Recently, tandem photovoltaic panels and a variety of new materials have emerged, bringing breakthroughs and surprises to the market again. Many experts and industry players are very optimistic about these two developments and believe that the photoelectric effect conversion rate of solar photovoltaic panels is expected to exceed 40% in the future. Since Bell Labs in the United States launched the first solar photovoltaic panel with practical application value in 1954, the materials of solar photovoltaic panels are mainly based on silicon. Over the next 60 years, the photoelectric effect conversion rate of silicon crystal solar photovoltaic panels has continued to improve from about 6% in the initial stage. In August 2017, Japan's Kaneka Corporation announced that it had successfully developed a silicon crystal solar photovoltaic panel with a photoelectric effect conversion rate of 26.63%, once again setting an industry record. The previous record was also set by Kaneka in September 2016, with a conversion rate of 26.33%. The previous record was set by Panasonic in April 2014, with a conversion rate of 25.6%. Silicon crystal only receives infrared light energy, and its performance has nearly reached its peak. However, after a closer look at the data, you will find that the conversion rate of silicon crystal solar photovoltaic panels has become difficult after exceeding 25%. Many industry players pointed out that the theoretical conversion rate of silicon crystal solar photovoltaic panels is only about 30% at most. Since there are several types of losses (including resistance, etc.) during the photoelectric effect, the actual value cannot reach the theoretical upper limit. In fact, in the past five years, the conversion rate of silicon solar photovoltaic panels seems to have not improved. Why does the conversion rate of silicon crystal solar photovoltaic panels have a theoretical upper limit of about 30%? The main reason is that this type of photovoltaic panels can only produce photoelectric effects on light in the infrared or near-red bands, and the energy in other bands of sunlight is wasted. In order to overcome this problem, some experts began to propose the tandem photovoltaic panel design many years ago: that is, a photovoltaic panel is composed of multiple overlapping absorption layers. Each absorption layer material can absorb light energy in a certain wavelength band to generate electricity. photoelectric effect. In this way, through division of labor and each performing his or her own duties, more solar energy can be converted into electricity, and it is possible for the conversion rate to reach 40% to 50%. Sure enough, the conversion rate of this series of photovoltaic panels has hit new highs repeatedly in recent years, which brings endless surprises. For example, on June 6, Sharp announced that it had developed a prototype of a tandem solar photovoltaic panel with a conversion rate of 32.65%. This prototype of a tandem solar photovoltaic panel includes three absorption layers. Each panel currently measures 34 cm x 29 cm, is bendable, and is very lightweight, weighing only 56 grams. Compared with the commonly used monocrystalline silicon or polycrystalline silicon solar photovoltaic panels, its weight and thickness are only a fraction. Although Sharp was very conservative, it only stated that it would continue to develop tandem solar photovoltaic panels with higher conversion rates and lower costs, hoping to be used in electric vehicles and space before 2050. However, the general industry and the media believe that judging from the size of the prototype, its commercial viability is already quite high. It should not take more than 20 years to mass-produce it, and it may be possible to mass-produce it in a few years. In fact, as early as April 2013, Sharp had developed a prototype of a tandem solar photovoltaic panel with a conversion rate of 37.9%. However, the prototype area at that time was only 1.047 square centimeters. It can be seen that in the past nine years, Sharp has greatly improved the relevant manufacturing processes and made great strides towards commercialization. In addition, in April 2020, the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) also developed a prototype of a tandem solar photovoltaic panel with 6 absorption layers and a conversion rate as high as 39.2%. Germany's Fraunhofer ISE developed a prototype of a tandem solar photovoltaic panel with a conversion rate of 35.9% in April 2021. However, the two did not talk in detail about the size and weight of their prototypes. It is believed that the area of __the prototypes is still very small, and it will be some time before commercial mass production. Perovskite is cost-effective and a rising star. The emergence of tandem solar photovoltaic panels is due to two major categories of new materials. The first category is compounds of arsenic (As), gallium (Ga), indium (In), etc. The second category is perovskite materials. Among them, the conversion rate of the first type of compounds is higher, but the cost is also higher, and may even be more expensive than silicon for the time being. The conversion rate of perovskite materials is slightly lower, but it is cost-effective, and its cost is at least half or more lower than that of single crystal silicon. At present, each tandem solar photovoltaic panel has several absorption layers, most of which are 3 to 6. At present, silicon still plays an important role, and the bottom layer may still use silicon. But in the long run, the industry hopes that perovskite materials can completely replace silicon. In fact, there has been a major breakthrough in the conversion rate of solar photovoltaic panels, which has convinced people from all walks of life that the application of this type of equipment to charging electric vehicles can definitely be successful, especially the electric ""tuk-tuk"" in Southeast Asia and South Asia.

The Hang Seng Index Dragged down by Chinese technology stocks, the index fell 464 points or 2.38% for the week. The cover story of this issue features an exclusive interview with Baring Asia Pacific Multi-Asset Investment Director Liang Hongjie to analyze the latest situation. Liang believes that the focus of this executive order is to report restrictions and requirements on some intangible benefits provided by U.S. direct investment in China, including access to talents, suppliers, and management support. The impact is more likely to be on private equity and start-up companies. Regarding private investment, it is believed that this move is unlikely to have a drastic impact on Sino-US relations. It is expected that the two countries will continue to cooperate on issues of common interest such as new energy and climate change, pointing to the current valuation of the Hong Kong and mainland stock markets. Attractive, there is room for improvement. Ming Pao reporter Ye Chuangcheng issued an executive order signed by US President Biden in the middle of last week to restrict investment in China's key technology fields. US asset management company Barings Liang Hongjie said in an exclusive interview: ""The goal of the Biden administration's proposed restrictions is to prevent the United States from Capital is financing Chinese technology startups that can potentially be used for military purposes. As part of this executive order, investment in advanced technologies such as semiconductors and artificial intelligence is prohibited. This does not bring surprise to the market because these technologies have already been exported. (Biden's administration has unveiled proposed restrictions aimed at preventing US capital from financing Chinese tech start-ups with potential military applications. A part of the executive order covers the ban on investments in advanced technology, e.g. semiconductor and AI, which are technically no new surprise as these technologies are already subject to export controls.). Liang Hongjie continued: ""We feel that the focus of this administrative order is mainly to impose restrictions and require declarations on the intangible benefits brought by direct investment - including access to talents, suppliers and management support. These restrictions are relatively focused. The impact is more likely to be on private investments such as private equity funds and start-ups. At this stage, it does not include restrictions on passive investments such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), so the impact on investments in the public market is not obvious (We think the focus). of the rules is evident in the restrictions and reporting requirements that primarily target active investments providing intangible benefits, such as acquisition of talent or suppliers and management assistance. The scope of the restriction was kept rather targeted, and impacts would be more likely to surround the private investment side, such as Private Equity or Early-Stage Start-up, etc. What is not included in the executive order at this stage is the exposure to those restricted areas through passive investments (e.g. ETF). As such, the impact on public investments would not be significant.)"" It will not hinder the improvement of Sino-US relations and there is still room for cooperation. As for the impact of this restriction order on Sino-US relations, Liang Hongjie analyzed: ""In the short term, this executive order is unlikely to improve Sino-US relations. The impact will be drastic, but it will indeed bring enlightenment to the long-term pattern, because it provides a precedent for the US government to control Chinese technology, and China and the United States are currently competing fiercely to master cutting-edge technology (In the near term, the executive order will unlikely have a drastic impact on the ongoing development of the China-US relationship. However, it does have implications for the longer-term picture as it establishes a precedent for the US government's tech control arsenal against China in the evolving competitive relationship surrounding frontier technologies.)"" ""In summary, we believe that the United States and China will maintain a competitive relationship, especially in strategic areas such as semiconductors and artificial intelligence. However, there are still areas where the two countries have common interests and can improve relations, such as new technologies. Energy and climate change issues. (Overall, we believe that the US and China will maintain a competitive relationship, especially in strategically important areas such as Semiconductors and AI. However, there are still areas in which the two nations can improve their relationship and find common interests, such as alternative energy and climate change related issues.) It is worth noting that as the last US President Trump announced the imposition of additional tariffs on China in the first quarter of 2018, the Hang Seng Index fell from a historical high of 33,484 points in January of that year, and fell to a low of 33,484 points in October of that year. It hit 24,540 points. However, as the market had been hoping for a chance for reconciliation between China and the United States for several months, the Hang Seng Index turned around and rebounded, reaching a high of 30,280 points on April 15, 2019. Liang Hongjie said in the 195th issue of ""Money Monday"" (April 23, 2019) Published), the cover story titled ""Stock Market Pounces, Funds Call on Risks"" pointed out that the valuation of the Hang Seng Index had become reasonable at that time. Unless an ideal agreement was reached in the Sino-US trade negotiations, the market's upside potential would be limited, and the Hang Seng Index was in the report. Later, it fell back near 30,000 points. It fell repeatedly in the rest of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020, falling to 21,139 points in March 2020. With the resumption of quantitative easing (QE) in the United States that month, it began to bottom out and rebound. However, in January 2021 After briefly returning to 30,000 points in February, it has fallen repeatedly over the past two and a half years, closing at 19,075 points last week (see Figure 1). In April 2019, the Hang Seng Index reached 30,000 points. This shows that Liang Hongjie reminded in April 2019 that ""the stock market should hit the top and avoid risks"". This is a very reliable point of view. Therefore, the reporter also asked for advice in this exclusive interview. What is his opinion on the Hong Kong stock market outlook? He first reviewed why the Hang Seng Index has performed so poorly in the past four years or so: ""China's ongoing campaign to remove tribute poles has implemented strict epidemic prevention and lockdown policies, as well as a series of reforms in technology, education and Regulatory reforms in real estate and other fields have had a significant impact on the confidence of local and foreign investors. The escalating tensions between China and the United States have added another foot to the bear market; and with the data released in recent months showing that the mainland's economic momentum has significantly strengthened, From November last year to January this year, the market's hope that the economy would recover strongly as the mainland relaxed epidemic control has also come to nothing. ""If Sino-US relations ""marginally improve"" and the risk premium of Hong Kong stocks decreases, Liang Hongjie believes in the above. Some negative factors should be expected to improve, he said: ""For example, as the mainland's economic momentum has slowed down significantly in recent months, the government has intervened to avoid further economic decline. The Political Bureau meeting held in late last month proposed interest rate cuts and RRR cuts. , relaxing restrictions on buyers in the property market and providing more financial support to private developers, etc., the market has also responded positively to this."" As for the political level, as mentioned above, Liang Hongjie believes that there is a chance for marginal improvement in Sino-US relations. It can ease the disruption to enterprises and supply chains: ""If Sino-US relations improve smoothly, the political risk premium of the Chinese stock market may decline, setting a lower barrier for investors. However, in the medium to long term, the United States and China may still They will be in a strategic competitive relationship in cutting-edge technology. It is difficult to estimate the long-term impact of this at present."" Overall, Liang Hongjie predicts that companies listed on the Hong Kong and even Chinese stock markets will announce their results during this period, that is, in the first half of this year. Earnings are still weak, but with policy support, it is believed that the corporate profit cycle will bottom out at some point in the second half of the year. In addition, the current valuation is attractive regardless of comparison with history (see Figure 2 and Figure 3) and other markets. The valuation is expected to be attractive. There is room for further improvement. The corporate profit cycle is expected to bottom out in the second half of the year and valuations have attracted attention. Reviewing the performance of Hong Kong stocks last week, ""Money Monday"" analyzed that affected by the United States' announcement of restrictions on Chinese technology investment, the Hang Seng Index fell 464 points or 2.38% for the whole week. The five major drags on the Hang Seng Index were blue chips. All four are related to this, except for Chinese technology and Internet stocks such as Meituan (3690), Tencent (0700) and JD.com (9618), which may be hindered in developing artificial intelligence business and it is expected to be difficult to introduce US capital when nurturing related local start-ups. , also includes Ping An Insurance (2318), which has invested in many technology companies in recent years (see table). In the ""Technology Winning"" column on page 19, the reporter also analyzed the technical trends of a number of stocks that may be affected by the U.S. restrictions on China's technology investment, including Chinese Internet technology stocks Tencent, Alibaba (9988), Meituan, Baidu ( 9888), JD.com and NetEase (9999), Chinese chip stocks SMIC (0981) and Hua Hong Semiconductor (1347), and Chinese artificial intelligence stock SenseTime (0020).

The Hang Seng Index Dragged down by Chinese technology stocks, the index fell 464 points or 2.38% for the week. The cover story of this issue features an exclusive interview with Baring Asia Pacific Multi-Asset Investment Director Liang Hongjie to analyze the latest situation. Liang believes that the focus of this executive order is to report restrictions and requirements on some intangible benefits provided by U.S. direct investment in China, including access to talents, suppliers, and management support. The impact is more likely to be on private equity and start-up companies. Regarding private investment, it is believed that this move is unlikely to have a drastic impact on Sino-US relations. It is expected that the two countries will continue to cooperate on issues of common interest such as new energy and climate change, pointing to the current valuation of the Hong Kong and mainland stock markets. Attractive, there is room for improvement. Ming Pao reporter Ye Chuangcheng issued an executive order signed by US President Biden in the middle of last week to restrict investment in China's key technology fields. US asset management company Barings Liang Hongjie said in an exclusive interview: ""The goal of the Biden administration's proposed restrictions is to prevent the United States from Capital is financing Chinese technology startups that can potentially be used for military purposes. As part of this executive order, investment in advanced technologies such as semiconductors and artificial intelligence is prohibited. This does not bring surprise to the market because these technologies have already been exported. (Biden's administration has unveiled proposed restrictions aimed at preventing US capital from financing Chinese tech start-ups with potential military applications. A part of the executive order covers the ban on investments in advanced technology, e.g. semiconductor and AI, which are technically no new surprise as these technologies are already subject to export controls.). Liang Hongjie continued: ""We feel that the focus of this administrative order is mainly to impose restrictions and require declarations on the intangible benefits brought by direct investment - including access to talents, suppliers and management support. These restrictions are relatively focused. The impact is more likely to be on private investments such as private equity funds and start-ups. At this stage, it does not include restrictions on passive investments such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), so the impact on investments in the public market is not obvious (We think the focus). of the rules is evident in the restrictions and reporting requirements that primarily target active investments providing intangible benefits, such as acquisition of talent or suppliers and management assistance. The scope of the restriction was kept rather targeted, and impacts would be more likely to surround the private investment side, such as Private Equity or Early-Stage Start-up, etc. What is not included in the executive order at this stage is the exposure to those restricted areas through passive investments (e.g. ETF). As such, the impact on public investments would not be significant.)"" It will not hinder the improvement of Sino-US relations and there is still room for cooperation. As for the impact of this restriction order on Sino-US relations, Liang Hongjie analyzed: ""In the short term, this executive order is unlikely to improve Sino-US relations. The impact will be drastic, but it will indeed bring enlightenment to the long-term pattern, because it provides a precedent for the US government to control Chinese technology, and China and the United States are currently competing fiercely to master cutting-edge technology (In the near term, the executive order will unlikely have a drastic impact on the ongoing development of the China-US relationship. However, it does have implications for the longer-term picture as it establishes a precedent for the US government's tech control arsenal against China in the evolving competitive relationship surrounding frontier technologies.)"" ""In summary, we believe that the United States and China will maintain a competitive relationship, especially in strategic areas such as semiconductors and artificial intelligence. However, there are still areas where the two countries have common interests and can improve relations, such as new technologies. Energy and climate change issues. (Overall, we believe that the US and China will maintain a competitive relationship, especially in strategically important areas such as Semiconductors and AI. However, there are still areas in which the two nations can improve their relationship and find common interests, such as alternative energy and climate change related issues.) It is worth noting that as the last US President Trump announced the imposition of additional tariffs on China in the first quarter of 2018, the Hang Seng Index fell from a historical high of 33,484 points in January of that year, and fell to a low of 33,484 points in October of that year. It hit 24,540 points. However, as the market had been hoping for a chance for reconciliation between China and the United States for several months, the Hang Seng Index turned around and rebounded, reaching a high of 30,280 points on April 15, 2019. Liang Hongjie said in the 195th issue of ""Money Monday"" (April 23, 2019) Published), the cover story titled ""Stock Market Pounces, Funds Call on Risks"" pointed out that the valuation of the Hang Seng Index had become reasonable at that time. Unless an ideal agreement was reached in the Sino-US trade negotiations, the market's upside potential would be limited, and the Hang Seng Index was in the report. Later, it fell back near 30,000 points. It fell repeatedly in the rest of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020, falling to 21,139 points in March 2020. With the resumption of quantitative easing (QE) in the United States that month, it began to bottom out and rebound. However, in January 2021 After briefly returning to 30,000 points in February, it has fallen repeatedly over the past two and a half years, closing at 19,075 points last week (see Figure 1). In April 2019, the Hang Seng Index reached 30,000 points. This shows that Liang Hongjie reminded in April 2019 that ""the stock market should hit the top and avoid risks"". This is a very reliable point of view. Therefore, the reporter also asked for advice in this exclusive interview. What is his opinion on the Hong Kong stock market outlook? He first reviewed why the Hang Seng Index has performed so poorly in the past four years or so: ""China's ongoing campaign to remove tribute poles has implemented strict epidemic prevention and lockdown policies, as well as a series of reforms in technology, education and Regulatory reforms in real estate and other fields have had a significant impact on the confidence of local and foreign investors. The escalating tensions between China and the United States have added another foot to the bear market; and with the data released in recent months showing that the mainland's economic momentum has significantly strengthened, From November last year to January this year, the market's hope that the economy would recover strongly as the mainland relaxed epidemic control has also come to nothing. ""If Sino-US relations ""marginally improve"" and the risk premium of Hong Kong stocks decreases, Liang Hongjie believes in the above. Some negative factors should be expected to improve, he said: ""For example, as the mainland's economic momentum has slowed down significantly in recent months, the government has intervened to avoid further economic decline. The Political Bureau meeting held in late last month proposed interest rate cuts and RRR cuts. , relaxing restrictions on buyers in the property market and providing more financial support to private developers, etc., the market has also responded positively to this."" As for the political level, as mentioned above, Liang Hongjie believes that there is a chance for marginal improvement in Sino-US relations. It can ease the disruption to enterprises and supply chains: ""If Sino-US relations improve smoothly, the political risk premium of the Chinese stock market may decline, setting a lower barrier for investors. However, in the medium to long term, the United States and China may still They will be in a strategic competitive relationship in cutting-edge technology. It is difficult to estimate the long-term impact of this at present."" Overall, Liang Hongjie predicts that companies listed on the Hong Kong and even Chinese stock markets will announce their results during this period, that is, in the first half of this year. Earnings are still weak, but with policy support, it is believed that the corporate profit cycle will bottom out at some point in the second half of the year. In addition, the current valuation is attractive regardless of comparison with history (see Figure 2 and Figure 3) and other markets. The valuation is expected to be attractive. There is room for further improvement. The corporate profit cycle is expected to bottom out in the second half of the year and valuations have attracted attention. Reviewing the performance of Hong Kong stocks last week, ""Money Monday"" analyzed that affected by the United States' announcement of restrictions on Chinese technology investment, the Hang Seng Index fell 464 points or 2.38% for the whole week. The five major drags on the Hang Seng Index were blue chips. All four are related to this, except for Chinese technology and Internet stocks such as Meituan (3690), Tencent (0700) and JD.com (9618), which may be hindered in developing artificial intelligence business and it is expected to be difficult to introduce US capital when nurturing related local start-ups. , also includes Ping An Insurance (2318), which has invested in many technology companies in recent years (see table). In the ""Technology Winning"" column on page 19, the reporter also analyzed the technical trends of a number of stocks that may be affected by the U.S. restrictions on China's technology investment, including Chinese Internet technology stocks Tencent, Alibaba (9988), Meituan, Baidu ( 9888), JD.com and NetEase (9999), Chinese chip stocks SMIC (0981) and Hua Hong Semiconductor (1347), and Chinese artificial intelligence stock SenseTime (0020).

Looking at the fashion industry, in recent years many new fashion designers have injected environmental protection concepts into their creativity. For example, they use recyclable materials to design clothing with the goal of reducing the source of waste and contributing to sustainable development. Although the times have advanced, it seems that it is not easy for the general public to turn the ""waste"" in the garbage dump into fashionable clothes. A sustainable fashion design competition that has been encouraging young designers to use their creativity since 2010 to change the fashion industry through sustainable and recycling design methods. This year, two Hong Kong representatives have advanced to the finals. Redress, an environmentally friendly fashion organization, holds a design competition with the theme of sustainable fashion every year. It aims to inspire and educate new fashion designers to apply sustainable design techniques and creativity based on the premise of minimum waste to reduce waste and promote recycling in the fashion industry. economy. As always, the 2023 ""Redress Design Competition"" attracted designers from different regions around the world to participate. This year, two local young designers, Mandy and Jasmine, were successfully shortlisted and will participate in the finals in mid-September. . Each finalist's work injects innovative solutions to the textile waste problem, such as repurposing denim rags into useful fabrics, transforming plastic and electronic waste into decorative items, and using zero-waste embroidery techniques that blend with the tailoring process. The extra tiny scraps of fabric are incorporated into the design. Rich colors and soft fabrics satisfy the body, mind and soul. Mandy already had a tall figure when she was a child, so she had the opportunity to be exposed to modeling activities and became interested in fashion. Since middle school, Mandy has participated in large and small competitions to deepen her understanding of fashion. Naturally, I took fashion as an elective when I entered university. After graduation, I entered the YDC (Hong Kong Young Fashion Designers Creative Contest). I also determined to have my own fashion brand and embarked on the path of becoming a fashion designer. She is concerned about sustainable fashion issues and hopes to gain a deeper understanding of the possibilities and development of sustainable fashion through participating in the competition, and to implement sustainable concepts in her creations. Regarding sustainable fashion, Mandy believes that this is one of the important issues in the world's fashion industry. ""Only clothing with a long life cycle and good quality can reduce the pollution of the earth by the clothing industry."" It is certainly not easy to make a good sustainable design. Mandy pointed out that the cost of money and time is higher: ""There may not be a huge customer base in the market, and multiple factors must be considered at the same time when designing styles, such as operating costs. ""In addition, although Mandy has only been working as a fashion designer in Hong Kong for just one year, she has already felt that Hong Kong's fashion industry is gradually declining. Many garment workers in cloth factories and processing plants are gradually retiring, causing disruptions in Hong Kong's fashion production chain. But she still persevered for her dream. ""Seeing this situation gave me the idea of contributing to the Hong Kong fashion industry. I hope that more young designers like me will continue to contribute to the industry, so that the Hong Kong fashion industry can regain its former glory."" Mandy writes Her design follows the classic romance style route.

Reconstruction Minister Tsuchiya Shinoko admitted yesterday (30th) that she first learned about the incident from news reports, saying that she had reflected on it and would strengthen the role of command and leadership in the future. The incident reflects problems in cross-departmental communication in the Japanese government. Five workers wearing protective clothing were cleaning the ALPS pipe used to purify nuclear sewage at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant last Wednesday (25th) when the hose detached from the storage tank and they were all sprayed out. During the nuclear sewage splash, four of the people had their skin stained by the nuclear sewage. However, after decontamination treatment, the radiation dose of the two people did not drop below the standard value, and they had to be hospitalized for observation. Fortunately, no abnormalities were found on the skin of the contaminated parts. Last week Liu was discharged from the hospital and continued to be under observation.

Emanuel suggested that the United States should expand research on how to help Japan offset the pressure of the ban, such as reviewing the total amount of aquatic products imported by the United States from Japan and China, and contacting the Japanese authorities to supply scallops to American processors. He said: ""The best way to eliminate China's economic threat is to provide support and assistance to the targeted countries or industries.""

Reconstruction Minister Tsuchiya Shinoko admitted yesterday (30th) that she first learned about the incident from news reports, saying that she had reflected on it and would strengthen the role of command and leadership in the future. The incident reflects problems in cross-departmental communication in the Japanese government. Five workers wearing protective clothing were cleaning the ALPS pipe used to purify nuclear sewage at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant last Wednesday (25th) when the hose detached from the storage tank and they were all sprayed out. During the nuclear sewage splash, four of the people had their skin stained by the nuclear sewage. However, after decontamination treatment, the radiation dose of the two people did not drop below the standard value, and they had to be hospitalized for observation. Fortunately, no abnormalities were found on the skin of the contaminated parts. Last week Liu was discharged from the hospital and continued to be under observation. Economy, Trade and Industry Minister Yasunomi Nishimura said he has instructed Tokyo Electric Power Company to take measures to prevent similar accidents from happening. Nosoko Tsuchiya said she was shocked and agreed to cooperate with various departments. When Nosoko Tsuchiya attended the House of Representatives Budget Committee meeting yesterday, she said: ""I learned about it from the news. When I heard about it, I was very shocked. I have reflected on it and should Cooperate with various departments. The Rehabilitation Department is the command tower and must play a practical role in the future. ""The purpose of the Reconstruction Department is to handle post-311 reconstruction and recovery work. Akiko Oka, a member of the Cadet Democratic Party, believes that the role of the Reconstruction Agency is vague. It did not learn about the incident of nuclear water splashing into workers from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry or Tepco, but learned about it through the media, which he thinks is very problematic. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on the same day that he received the report through his secretary and agreed that communication and cooperation between relevant departments and agencies are important and require a ""thorough review."" U.S. troops stationed in Japan purchase Japanese seafood to help Japan cope with the China ban. Tokyo Electric Power Company yesterday began preparing to discharge about 7,800 tons of nuclear sewage from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the sea for the third time on November 2. In an interview with Reuters yesterday, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Emanuel (pictured, Reuters) described China's complete ban on the import of Japanese aquatic products as part of an ""economic war"" because of Japan's discharge of nuclear wastewater. Emanuel suggested that the United States should expand research on how to help Japan offset the pressure of the ban, such as reviewing the total amount of aquatic products imported by the United States from Japan and China, and contacting the Japanese authorities to supply scallops to American processors. He said: ""The best way to eliminate China's economic threat is to provide support and assistance to the targeted countries or industries."" He revealed that he had purchased Japanese seafood for the first time for the US military stationed in Japan. The first batch was nearly 1 ton of tape for soldiers. Meals are sold in stores and restaurants on military bases. The US military will expand the types and quantities of procurement in the future.",Hong-Kong,Ming Pao ,,748

One of its tasks is to recycle edible ingredients from the market, sort them and distribute them to grassroots families; they also invited Nutritionists and chefs demonstrate how to use up all the ingredients to cook wholesome meals. Yuan Dezhi, executive director of Food Ethics, said that many people can't tell whether the ingredients are edible. They think that insect-eaten vegetable leaves or processed foods that are about to expire are inedible. They even remove the vegetable leaves to keep them fresh and tender. As for the cabbage core, a lot of food was wasted. The Food Waste Index report released by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) last year pointed out that humans waste approximately 1 billion tons of food every year, of which about one-third is discarded without being eaten. It is not difficult to develop the habit of being careful about food. He suggested that you can refer to the following methods. _Limited Shopping: Vendors often offer offers such as buy two get one free, buy more, get more free, etc. However, if you buy too much, the ingredients may go bad during storage, and cans may also expire easily, so you should buy just enough. _Make good use of leftovers: If the food is overcooked, you can put it in a container and store it in the refrigerator. The next day, you can cut the leftovers into cubes and fry them with rice, and mince the leftover meat and scrambled eggs. They should not be thrown away easily. In addition, many people are accustomed to cutting off the irregular parts of the head and tail when cutting melons, fruits and potatoes. In fact, the head and tail can be used to boil soup, or use beetroot juice for tie-dying and other crafts. _Shorten the cooking time: Many people like to drink ""Laohuo soup"", thinking that it takes a long time to cook out the ""essence"" of medicinal herbs and ingredients. However, the longer the soup is cooked, the heat will accelerate the loss of vitamins B and C in fruits and vegetables, which will cause The nutritional value of the food itself is wasted. In fact, most medicinal herbs and ingredients will release their flavor within 1 hour of cooking. Cutting the ingredients into fine pieces can also help shorten the cooking time, retain nutrients, and reduce energy consumption. _Eat from time to time: There are many fruits in summer and leafy vegetables in autumn and winter. In addition to being delicious, the food at the right time is also more environmentally friendly. If you buy crops that are out of season, it means that the crops require more labor and fertilizers during the planting process, or they have to be imported from areas with opposite climates, which wastes resources in cultivation and transportation. fb: Food Grace is a hot trend. The concept of naked shopping to reduce waste at the source is becoming increasingly popular. From food such as grains, oils, noodles, candies, to daily necessities such as soap, shampoo, cosmetics, etc., everyone can bring their own containers and store them locally.

Greenpeace this year launched the ""Comprehensive Guide to Reusing and Recycling Naked Shops"" e-book (bit.ly/3Urvq2v), which includes the locations of naked shops in Hong Kong, Kowloon and the New Territories, allowing everyone to try to reduce waste at the source and reduce unnecessary plastic packaging. Slowood, an environmentally friendly department store that has been in business for more than three years, hopes to bring sustainable living to different communities. Store operations manager Tania Liao said that shopping naked is very common in foreign countries, and the method is not complicated or troublesome. You dont need to carry a lot of weight.

If you have a terrace at home to grow flowers and vegetables, you might consider buying a kitchen waste machine to make your own organic fertilizer. Household food waste machines are mainly divided into three categories, including crushing type, drying type and biodegradable type. The crushing type can crush the food waste and then dispose it as garbage. The dry type can crush the food waste and then dry it with heat. Then it can be Discard directly or use as fertilizer. In the biodegradable method, yeast and water must be poured into the machine. After the microorganisms perform their decomposition, the food waste can be poured in and converted into organic fertilizer. Each of the three models has its own advantages, and you can choose one according to your actual needs. Take the Korean brand small food waste machine Reencle RC-02 as an example.

As long as you are willing to take the first step and explore the environmental protection people and things around you, you will find green support everywhere. Then pay attention to the details of daily life and gradually practice environmental protection. Reduce waste with ease. A bone mask turns into a thumb piano, an aluminum can turns into a bird, a plastic grain and oil barrel turns into a light box speaker, a rice cooker liner turns into a bicycle bell, and wallpaper turns into a wallet. ""Waste"" can not only be recycled, but also upcycled into higher value. items. Transform according to material characteristics and save complicated processes. Designer Kevin Zhang (Kevin), who has been working in upcycling for 11 years, is good at turning what ordinary people think of as ""garbage"" into installation art or various products. He pointed out that recycling has many processes, involving a lot of manpower and material resources in transportation, classification, processing and other links; while upcycling eliminates complicated processes and ""uses the characteristics of materials to turn them into useful things with minimal transformation."" Therefore, remade products will contain a ""story"", making it easier for everyone to recognize their predecessors. For example, he modified aluminum cans into an interactive color-changing hanging. He also tried converting aluminum cans into Mid-Autumn Festival lanterns and paper-wrapped drink boxes into windmills. These upcycling items can be recycled in the future, but before that, he Give them a ""second life"". Strengthen awareness and empathy to practice environmental protection. Kevin has noticed that the publics discussion on environmental protection has increased in recent years. I will use upcycling as a communication tool. Everyones goal is to reduce waste, whether it is buying second-hand shirts or wrapping drink boxes in paper. Bringing it to the Mil Mill (recycling plant), sending the washing machine to the green district (recycling point), or thinking about whether it is necessary before consuming it, are actually promoting reflection on consumer behavior, and upcycling is also one of them."" However, Kevin understands that when there is no time and space, people are more likely to choose to buy and discard things. The most important thing is to raise everyones values __to think about more than just themselves. For example, after discarding a cabinet, it will affect the environment or downstream recycling. Everyone has an impact. I hope everyone has this level of awareness and empathy to practice environmental protection."" _4 Tips for Waste Reduction Food Cherish and Eat Well is a non-profit organization founded in 2009 to promote the culture of food conservation. One of its tasks is to recycle edible ingredients from the market, sort them and distribute them to grassroots families; they also invited Nutritionists and chefs demonstrate how to use up all the ingredients to cook wholesome meals. Yuan Dezhi, executive director of Food Ethics, said that many people can't tell whether the ingredients are edible. They think that insect-eaten vegetable leaves or processed foods that are about to expire are inedible. They even remove the vegetable leaves to keep them fresh and tender. As for the cabbage core, a lot of food was wasted. The Food Waste Index report released by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) last year pointed out that humans waste approximately 1 billion tons of food every year, of which about one-third is discarded without being eaten. It is not difficult to develop the habit of being careful about food. He suggested that you can refer to the following methods. _Limited Shopping: Vendors often offer offers such as buy two get one free, buy more, get more free, etc. However, if you buy too much, the ingredients may go bad during storage, and cans may also expire easily, so you should buy just enough. _Make good use of leftovers: If the food is overcooked, you can put it in a container and store it in the refrigerator. The next day, you can cut the leftovers into cubes and fry them with rice, and mince the leftover meat and scrambled eggs. They should not be thrown away easily. In addition, many people are accustomed to cutting off the irregular parts of the head and tail when cutting melons, fruits and potatoes. In fact, the head and tail can be used to boil soup, or use beetroot juice for tie-dying and other crafts. _Shorten the cooking time: Many people like to drink ""Laohuo soup"", thinking that it takes a long time to cook out the ""essence"" of medicinal herbs and ingredients. However, the longer the soup is cooked, the heat will accelerate the loss of vitamins B and C in fruits and vegetables, which will cause The nutritional value of the food itself is wasted. In fact, most medicinal herbs and ingredients will release their flavor within 1 hour of cooking. Cutting the ingredients into fine pieces can also help shorten the cooking time, retain nutrients, and reduce energy consumption. _Eat from time to time: There are many fruits in summer and leafy vegetables in autumn and winter. In addition to being delicious, the food at the right time is also more environmentally friendly. If you buy crops that are out of season, it means that the crops require more labor and fertilizers during the planting process, or they have to be imported from areas with opposite climates, which wastes resources in cultivation and transportation. fb: Food Grace is a hot trend. The concept of naked shopping to reduce waste at the source is becoming increasingly popular. From food such as grains, oils, noodles, candies, to daily necessities such as soap, shampoo, cosmetics, etc., everyone can bring their own containers and store them locally. Shop naked to buy products without prepackaging. Greenpeace this year launched the ""Comprehensive Guide to Reusing and Recycling Naked Shops"" e-book (bit.ly/3Urvq2v), which includes the locations of naked shops in Hong Kong, Kowloon and the New Territories, allowing everyone to try to reduce waste at the source and reduce unnecessary plastic packaging. Slowood, an environmentally friendly department store that has been in business for more than three years, hopes to bring sustainable living to different communities. Store operations manager Tania Liao said that shopping naked is very common in foreign countries, and the method is not complicated or troublesome. You dont need to carry a lot of weight. For glass bottles, a light-weight dense bag or paper bag is enough."" Hold the required amount and weight by yourself, then write the product number and weight, and finally go to the cashier to check out. The naked shopping model is a bit like recreating the grocery store of the past, reducing unnecessary packaging. ""The most important thing is that you can only buy the required amount and reduce food waste."" Website: www.slowood.hk Intelligent floating bookcase, one app for donating books and picking up books. Floating books and reading second-hand books has become a habit of many book lovers, but there are many people donating books and few picking up books. Fan Zhaobang, one of the founders of the social enterprise ""Yituanzhi"", believes that this is related to the inconvenient transportation of the book floating place, so he and his partners launched a smart floating bookcase to speed up the process of donating and picking up books. The first smart floating bookcase was launched at the Central Market in February this year. There are currently 5 machines located in Tsuen Wan, Kwai Fong, Lam Tin and Siu Sai Wan. If you want to donate or pick up books, you can use the dedicated mobile app or online application service of Yiluzhi. Register as a member, scan the ISBN international standard book number on the book before donating it, select the book you want to pick up, and then go to the smart cabinet to donate or pick up the book at the designated time. Website: webapp.onepile.co Food Waste Machine DIY Organic Fertilizer Garbage can be recycled, but how to deal with food waste? If you have a terrace at home to grow flowers and vegetables, you might consider buying a kitchen waste machine to make your own organic fertilizer. Household food waste machines are mainly divided into three categories, including crushing type, drying type and biodegradable type. The crushing type can crush the food waste and then dispose it as garbage. The dry type can crush the food waste and then dry it with heat. Then it can be Discard directly or use as fertilizer. In the biodegradable method, yeast and water must be poured into the machine. After the microorganisms perform their decomposition, the food waste can be poured in and converted into organic fertilizer. Each of the three models has its own advantages, and you can choose one according to your actual needs. Take the Korean brand small food waste machine Reencle RC-02 as an example. By mixing food waste and microorganisms and controlling temperature and humidity, it can process 1kg of food waste per day. The body is equipped with an air purification device, so no odor will leak out during the decomposition process. ",Hong-Kong,Ming Pao ,,1850

The cost of this project is estimated to be as high as HK$580 billion (enough to build 760,000 public housing units, and there are only 850,000 public housing units in Hong Kong). However, the report is thinner than previous similar documents, and even the responses are only compiled. ""A summary of the published responses"" is disappointing. Looking at the cover of the report, I always feel that there is something wrong with the proportions. Of course these are not architectural drawings, but do they also need to present images that correspond to real conditions? The buildings on the two islands in front of the cover are obviously high-rise buildings, but their height is not much higher than the buildings in the public space nearby. It is even similar and disproportionately high to some of the buildings on the island behind the cover. In fact, the most ideal thing is to show everyone a proportional conceptual diagram, so that the public can understand what it will probably look like in the future. After all, whether the density of artificial islands is too high is still a concern. Differences from the Land Debate Report As for the content of the report, there are many differences from previous public participation reports such as the Land Debate or other new development areas. For example, in the 2018 land debate, citizens opinions were collected through different channels, including online, telephone surveys, submissions from citizens, and quantitative and qualitative analyses. Previous public participation reports would mention supporting and opposing opinions and provide detailed responses. But these were not included in this report. The Artificial Island Report stated that among the 7,800 public opinions, about 60% expressed support for the project, about 25% opposed it, and the rest had no clear position. However, we have not been able to look at these comments in detail. In fact, as long as prospective participants are asked when collecting opinions, these opinions should be able to be shared with the public through the Internet. Out of curiosity, the author tried to classify the comprehensive opinions. Regarding length, I dont understand why agree opinions account for 60% of the total. The first category is favorable opinions, accounting for a little more than 20% of all summarized opinions. For example, support the design of 3 islands; artificial islands should be able to alleviate housing shortages, improve open space and community facility standards to improve the quality of life; ""15-minute living circle"" and mixed-use planning; do a good job in ""blue-green network"" and biological diversity, enhance the ecological environment; strengthen the connections between various districts in Hong Kong and the overall transportation network. But in terms of length, 60% of it is not clear why. Perhaps, the government also classifies the suggestions as in favor? In fact, the author is not in favor of building artificial islands, but if the government insists on going its own way, I can only suggest that they use the most advanced and environmentally friendly methods to do it. The suggestion category accounted for approximately one-third of all comments, mostly regarding land, transportation and financing. For example, how to sequester carbon; design public spaces well while improving coastal defense capabilities; protect the ecology around artificial islands; adopt green, environmentally friendly and energy-saving building designs to properly handle food waste and waste; retain planning flexibility and provide land for more creative development; artificial islands should adopt innovative technologies; prohibit carbon-emitting vehicles from entering and exiting artificial islands; various arrangements to strengthen the connection between artificial islands and various districts; and different financing options. The rest are objections and doubts. For example, the ""Y-shaped"" waterway design and its impact on marine ecology; no strategic environmental assessment has been conducted; questions about the resilience of artificial islands in the current climate crisis, and why they do not closely follow the national ecological civilization strategy; from population decline and ""post-epidemic"" ""The demand for space for commercial land has changed, raising the question of whether artificial islands are needed; there are concerns about the proportion of public-private housing and the balance between employment and housing; the density of artificial islands is too high; there are concerns that transportation costs will be too high in the future, and will affect the original urban areas of Yuen Long, Tsuen Wan, and Kennedy Town road network. Most of the objections are to the financing arrangements, fearing that they will follow the example of foreign reclamation failures; international financial markets are unstable, and worries that the project will become a burden on the next generation of taxpayers; the cost may be underestimated (due to inflation and construction to withstand extreme weather) infrastructure is extremely expensive), and earnings are too optimistic (especially as property and land prices are declining); there are concerns that artificial islands will drag down Hong Kong's international credit rating, etc. Citizens' opinions should be respected. Regarding the comprehensive opinions of the report, it is not necessarily that 60% of the people support it. On the contrary, everyone still has many suggestions and doubts. Therefore, the author is most disappointed with the fourth part of the report, ""Summaries of Responses Published."" Since the government has received so many opinions, should it respond seriously? If the ""Independent Reclamation and Coastal Resilience Expert Committee"" agrees with the design strategy, can you share their professional opinions? As for ecology and fisheries, since there are no insurmountable problems, what else can we do besides losing money? So many people are worried about financing arrangements. How will the government deal with it? In fact, all the suggestions and questions in the report deserve the government's response. NT$580 billion is not a small amount, and with the social and ecological costs, people in Hong Kong and even this region will have to ""pay the bill"" in the future. The city belongs to everyone, and every citizen should be heard and respected when expressing their opinions. We are all ""city people"" and are born place makers.

The cost of this project is estimated to be as high as HK$580 billion (enough to build 760,000 public housing units, and there are only 850,000 public housing units in Hong Kong). However, the report is thinner than previous similar documents, and even the responses are only compiled. ""A summary of the published responses"" is disappointing. Looking at the cover of the report, I always feel that there is something wrong with the proportions. Of course these are not architectural drawings, but do they also need to present images that correspond to real conditions? The buildings on the two islands in front of the cover are obviously high-rise buildings, but their height is not much higher than the buildings in the public space nearby. It is even similar and disproportionately high to some of the buildings on the island behind the cover. In fact, the most ideal thing is to show everyone a proportional conceptual diagram, so that the public can understand what it will probably look like in the future. After all, whether the density of artificial islands is too high is still a concern. Differences from the Land Debate Report As for the content of the report, there are many differences from previous public participation reports such as the Land Debate or other new development areas. For example, in the 2018 land debate, citizens opinions were collected through different channels, including online, telephone surveys, submissions from citizens, and quantitative and qualitative analyses. Previous public participation reports would mention supporting and opposing opinions and provide detailed responses. But these were not included in this report. The Artificial Island Report stated that among the 7,800 public opinions, about 60% expressed support for the project, about 25% opposed it, and the rest had no clear position. However, we have not been able to look at these comments in detail. In fact, as long as prospective participants are asked when collecting opinions, these opinions should be able to be shared with the public through the Internet. Out of curiosity, the author tried to classify the comprehensive opinions. Regarding length, I dont understand why agree opinions account for 60% of the total. The first category is favorable opinions, accounting for a little more than 20% of all summarized opinions. For example, support the design of 3 islands; artificial islands should be able to alleviate housing shortages, improve open space and community facility standards to improve the quality of life; ""15-minute living circle"" and mixed-use planning; do a good job in ""blue-green network"" and biological diversity, enhance the ecological environment; strengthen the connections between various districts in Hong Kong and the overall transportation network. But in terms of length, 60% of it is not clear why. Perhaps, the government also classifies the suggestions as in favor? In fact, the author is not in favor of building artificial islands, but if the government insists on going its own way, I can only suggest that they use the most advanced and environmentally friendly methods to do it. The suggestion category accounted for approximately one-third of all comments, mostly regarding land, transportation and financing. For example, how to sequester carbon; design public spaces well while improving coastal defense capabilities; protect the ecology around artificial islands; adopt green, environmentally friendly and energy-saving building designs to properly handle food waste and waste; retain planning flexibility and provide land for more creative development; artificial islands should adopt innovative technologies; prohibit carbon-emitting vehicles from entering and exiting artificial islands; various arrangements to strengthen the connection between artificial islands and various districts; and different financing options. The rest are objections and doubts. For example, the ""Y-shaped"" waterway design and its impact on marine ecology; no strategic environmental assessment has been conducted; questions about the resilience of artificial islands in the current climate crisis, and why they do not closely follow the national ecological civilization strategy; from population decline and ""post-epidemic"" ""The demand for space for commercial land has changed, raising the question of whether artificial islands are needed; there are concerns about the proportion of public-private housing and the balance between employment and housing; the density of artificial islands is too high; there are concerns that transportation costs will be too high in the future, and will affect the original urban areas of Yuen Long, Tsuen Wan, and Kennedy Town road network. Most of the objections are to the financing arrangements, fearing that they will follow the example of foreign reclamation failures; international financial markets are unstable, and worries that the project will become a burden on the next generation of taxpayers; the cost may be underestimated (due to inflation and construction to withstand extreme weather) infrastructure is extremely expensive), and earnings are too optimistic (especially as property and land prices are declining); there are concerns that artificial islands will drag down Hong Kong's international credit rating, etc. Citizens' opinions should be respected. Regarding the comprehensive opinions of the report, it is not necessarily that 60% of the people support it. On the contrary, everyone still has many suggestions and doubts. Therefore, the author is most disappointed with the fourth part of the report, ""Summaries of Responses Published."" Since the government has received so many opinions, should it respond seriously? If the ""Independent Reclamation and Coastal Resilience Expert Committee"" agrees with the design strategy, can you share their professional opinions? As for ecology and fisheries, since there are no insurmountable problems, what else can we do besides losing money? So many people are worried about financing arrangements. How will the government deal with it? In fact, all the suggestions and questions in the report deserve the government's response. NT$580 billion is not a small amount, and with the social and ecological costs, people in Hong Kong and even this region will have to ""pay the bill"" in the future. The city belongs to everyone, and every citizen should be heard and respected when expressing their opinions. We are all ""city people"" and are born place makers. We should have the responsibility and obligation to plan the future of this city together.

Exceeding the historical record set in 2013. Some Hong Kong businessmen have proposed turning useless crop waste into environmentally friendly fuel, hoping to burn it mixed with coal to gradually reduce the use of the latter. Ming Pao reporter Xue Weijie Photography Lai Junjie Yang Jingmin, managing director of SSGE Bio-Energy, and Kuang Junheng, director of sales department, said that the company was established in 2012 and specializes in ""biomass"" fuel. Initially, we considered producing wood pellet fuel, but found that the amount of waste wood collected from construction sites was limited. Planting and cutting down trees to produce wood pellet fuel would increase carbon dioxide emissions, and foreign buyers would not accept it. As a result, we recycle useless crop waste, such as chaff, peanut shells, bagasse, corn stalks, bean stems, etc., and process them with self-developed roasting technology to produce biocoal called AGRI BioCoal. material fuel. The surface is hydrophobic and can still burn after being soaked in water for two hours. They said that crop waste particles that have not been treated with baking technology are not waterproof and are difficult to burn once soaked in water. The company's bio-coal has a hydrophobic surface after being baked, even if It can burn easily after being immersed in water for two hours; this is important since coal is often stored in open air in steel mills and power plants. Secondly, during storage, crop waste particles that have not been roasted will release heat and greenhouse effect of methane that is 26 times equivalent to carbon dioxide due to fermentation, and even burn themselves, losing part of it; after the company's biocoal has been roasted, There is no such problem. Third, the combustion of crop waste particles that have not been processed by roasting technology generates more than 3,000 to 4,200 kcal per kilogram. The company's biocoal will remove some low-energy and volatile substances during the roasting process, so the heat generated by combustion per kilogram is about 4800 to 5000kcal, which is equivalent to high-quality coal (the heat generated by combustion per kilogram of coal is approximately ranging from 2800 to 5500kcal). Myanmar recycles agricultural waste and makes bio-coal for sale in Europe. In short, the company's bio-coal is easy to transport and store, and is more suitable for industrial use. In addition, its bio-coal can be ground into powder and burned together with coal, which is very important because it is not feasible to completely replace coal burning in a short time. As for the carbon dioxide emissions produced when burning bio-coal, it is similar to that of natural gas. Because it is made from crop waste, it is considered a carbon-neutral fuel like other biomass fuels. The company began recycling crop waste in Myanmar in November last year to produce biocoal, which it sells to a European company, which is then packaged into retail fuel and sold to European households for use in indoor fireplaces for heating. Currently, the company's Myanmar factory employs about 1,000 workers for production, and another 1,000 workers specialize in collecting crop waste from about 5,000 rural farms in the surrounding area of about 40,000 square kilometers, and transporting it to more than 600 temporary storage points. Then transport it back to the factory. In order to reduce carbon emissions, ox-carts will be used as much as possible for short-distance transportation, and boats will be rented for long-distance transportation via inland rivers. Goal: To replace coal and sell it to steel mills and power plants. The companys real goal is to sell biocoal to steel mills and power plants to replace part of the coal. However, since the current annual production capacity is only 300,000 tons at most (based on three shifts), the scale is still too small for steel mills and power plants, and it has not been possible for the time being. From research and development to factory establishment, Changsen Renewable Energy Co., Ltd. has accumulated investment of nearly US$100 million, not counting wages. The company hopes to use financing to increase its annual production capacity to 3 million tons, reaching the threshold of supplying steel mills or power plants.

Goal: To replace coal and sell it to steel mills and power plants. The companys real goal is to sell biocoal to steel mills and power plants to replace part of the coal. However, since the current annual production capacity is only 300,000 tons at most (based on three shifts), the scale is still too small for steel mills and power plants, and it has not been possible for the time being. From research and development to factory establishment, Changsen Renewable Energy Co., Ltd. has accumulated investment of nearly US$100 million, not counting wages. The company hopes to use financing to increase its annual production capacity to 3 million tons, reaching the threshold of supplying steel mills or power plants.

According to the agreement, EU member states will adopt their own measures from August 1 this year to March 31 next year to reduce natural gas demand by 15% based on average consumption over the past five years. The move is aimed at preparing for winter ahead of possible disruptions to Russian natural gas supplies. Reporters observed in Hannover, Germany that the lighting in city hall, museums and scenic spots was turned off, and all public fountains stopped operating. Hot water is no longer available in showers at public swimming pools and gyms and gyms. Comprehensive restrictions on public electricity use Hannover, the capital of Lower Saxony, Germany, known as the ""Exposition City"", was one of the first German cities to propose a natural gas conservation plan. The reporter visited the city last weekend and found that unlike previous summers, the public fountains in squares in Hannover had stopped spraying water, and the scenes of children playing in the water had also disappeared. When the reporter was working out at a fitness center called MCFit, he discovered that the bathing area no longer provided hot water as usual. After nightfall, the lights of attractions and public institutions in the city are turned off, leaving only some necessary road lighting. According to the energy saving regulations of the city of Hannover. The city will shorten heating hours this year. From October 1 this year to March 31 next year, government office buildings will only be heated, and the maximum room temperature may only be maintained at 20 degrees. In storage rooms, technical rooms, corridors and other places, the temperature is only 10 to 15 degrees. However, daycare centres, schools, nursing homes and clinics are exempt from energy-saving measures. In the past, the heating season in Germany lasted until the end of April of the following year. Hannover Mayor Belit Onai said that the city hall will further restrict the use of electronic equipment such as printers and refrigerators, and ban air conditioners and heaters. The mayor hopes companies and other institutions will follow the government's measures. Many Hannover companies and local citizens reported to reporters that they have tried their best to save the use of natural gas and other energy sources, and now have almost reached the limit where they can control their use. At the same time, many cities, including Hannover, still hope to further curb natural gas use by raising gas prices. Germany is also developing a law to ban the use of natural gas to heat private swimming pools in winter. People's lives have been greatly affected. Data show that about one-third of Germany's natural gas consumption comes from private households, and on average one of every two apartments uses natural gas for heating. These days, many households in Hannover have received the unpleasant notice that energy suppliers are passing on increased gas prices to residential customers. Natural gas will be more expensive from October 1st. All natural gas customers should pay a surcharge of up to 0.05 per kWh. Based on estimates of consumption levels in 2021, in a 100-square-meter apartment, the average annual natural gas consumption for a family of four is approximately 18,000 kilowatt-hours, and the natural gas bill reaches 1,080 euros. With the current price plus a gasoline surcharge of 0.05 euros, the cost will be several times higher than last year and even equivalent to the average German's monthly income. Miller, director of Germany's Federal Network Agency, told the ""German Editorial Network"" that natural gas prices may triple by early next year. The reporter came to Media City, the largest electrical appliance chain store in Hannover, and found that a variety of electric heaters were on display here. But the store clerk told reporters that all electric heaters were sold out and the exhibits could not be sold. Now they had to wait for new heaters to be shipped from China. Many firewood factories are also in crisis. The reporter visited two home furnishing chain stores and found out. The firewood and sawdust here have already been sold out. Youdan, a citizen of Hanover who did not buy firewood, was a little disappointed. He told reporters that he wanted to prevent insufficient heating in autumn and winter and avoid freezing. He has replaced the natural gas heating system with a fireplace. In addition to cutting off sources, the city of Hannover is also opening up rivers. As an alternative to natural gas power generation, Germany's first hard coal power plant, the Mehrum power plant located near Hannover, recently ended its ""reserve status"" and resumed power generation. Faber, the general manager of the power plant, said frankly that the power plant is not yet able to operate at full capacity. ""The current situation of the power plant is comparable to a car that has been parked in a garage for eight months. It is not sure whether it can be restarted."" The Mehrum power plant can provide electricity for 500,000 households, but the power plant serves the entire state of Lower Saxony and cannot really solve the energy crisis in Hannover. According to data from the German Federal Network Agency, natural gas power generation accounted for 11.2% of Germany's power generation in June. Coal-fired power plants in the German states of Saarland and North Rhine-Westphalia will also be connected to the grid. Hannover Mayor Belit Onai emphasized that the city hopes to promote the use of renewable energy. The city of Hannover and the state government of Niederssen have rented solar roofs from the Hannover-based energy supplier enercity to install on the roofs of hundreds of buildings. By 2025, it will generate more than 15 gigawatt hours of electricity - enough to power 6,200 homes. European countries are trying to save money at the expense of their own citizens. Russian Satellite News Agency reported on August 1 that Russian energy expert Dmitry Gusev said that the EUs decision was not calculated. Its unwise. They havent calculated what will happen if people take less showers? Thats a health issue. Or what will happen if people have increased cardiovascular disease without air conditioning? If people stop traveling, the retail industry What will happen? ""The shadow of recession is approaching. As Europe's largest economy, Germany, under heavy pressure, may have already fallen into recession. According to data from the European Statistical Office, compared with the first quarter of this year, Germany's GDP growth rate in the second quarter was 0%, lower than the 0.1% growth expected by economists. Looking at two decimal places, the country's GDP index actually shrank by 0.04%. Economists at Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank predict the German economy will contract quarterly from the second half of the year until at least the spring. ""Deutsche Welle"" reported on August 1 that due to the impact of high inflation, the new coronavirus epidemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Germany's retail trade turnover ended the first half of this year with the largest decline in 28 years. Statistics provided by the German Federal Statistics Office that day showed that after deducting inflation factors, sales in June fell by 8.8% year-on-year. Economists predict tough times ahead for the retail industry. The Russian Satellite News Agency quoted Korneichuk, an associate professor at the Russian Government's School of Finance, as saying that the decline in Russian natural gas consumption is bringing the Eurozone economy close to recession and may have irreparable consequences for energy-intensive industries and the Eurozone economy. Enforcing restrictions on Russian gas consumption for political reasons, switching to expensive LNG, and relying on ""green"" energy will not help the European economy. As a result, the Eurozone economy is heading rapidly towards recession. Giving up Russian gas would be costly for Europeans. According to a report by Russia's ""Independent"" on August 2, Gazprom reported that global natural gas demand in the first seven months of 2022 will decrease by 35 billion cubic meters year-on-year, and the decline in EU demand is a key factor. The average price of natural gas on European exchanges rose by almost 50% in July, crossing the $1,800 per thousand cubic meter mark. TTF benchmark Dutch natural gas futures are already trading between $1,500-2,400 per thousand cubic meters, compared with less than $500 a year ago. It is the United States that stands to benefit from the crisis. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) cited CEDIGAZ data on August 1 as saying that with increased supply to Europe, the United States became the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas in the first half of 2022. The EIA said that in the first five months of this year, about 71% of U.S. LNG exports went to the European Union and the United Kingdom.",Mainland China,Global Times,,2181

The reporter visited the city last weekend and found that unlike previous summers, the public fountains in squares in Hannover had stopped spraying water, and the scenes of children playing in the water had also disappeared. When the reporter was working out at a fitness center called MCFit, he discovered that the bathing area no longer provided hot water as usual. After nightfall, the lights of attractions and public institutions in the city are turned off, leaving only some necessary road lighting. According to the energy saving regulations of the city of Hannover. The city will shorten heating hours this year. From October 1 this year to March 31 next year, government office buildings will only be heated, and the maximum room temperature may only be maintained at 20 degrees. In storage rooms, technical rooms, corridors and other places, the temperature is only 10 to 15 degrees. However, daycare centres, schools, nursing homes and clinics are exempt from energy-saving measures. In the past, the heating season in Germany lasted until the end of April of the following year. Hannover Mayor Belit Onai said that the city hall will further restrict the use of electronic equipment such as printers and refrigerators, and ban air conditioners and heaters. The mayor hopes companies and other institutions will follow the government's measures. Many Hannover companies and local citizens reported to reporters that they have tried their best to save the use of natural gas and other energy sources, and now have almost reached the limit where they can control their use. At the same time, many cities, including Hannover, still hope to further curb natural gas use by raising gas prices. Germany is also developing a law to ban the use of natural gas to heat private swimming pools in winter. People's lives have been greatly affected. Data show that about one-third of Germany's natural gas consumption comes from private households, and on average one of every two apartments uses natural gas for heating. These days, many households in Hannover have received the unpleasant notice that energy suppliers are passing on increased gas prices to residential customers. Natural gas will be more expensive from October 1st. All natural gas customers should pay a surcharge of up to 0.05 per kWh. Based on estimates of consumption levels in 2021, in a 100-square-meter apartment, the average annual natural gas consumption for a family of four is approximately 18,000 kilowatt-hours, and the natural gas bill reaches 1,080 euros. With the current price plus a gasoline surcharge of 0.05 euros, the cost will be several times higher than last year and even equivalent to the average German's monthly income. Miller, director of Germany's Federal Network Agency, told the ""German Editorial Network"" that natural gas prices may triple by early next year. The reporter came to Media City, the largest electrical appliance chain store in Hannover, and found that a variety of electric heaters were on display here. But the store clerk told reporters that all electric heaters were sold out and the exhibits could not be sold. Now they had to wait for new heaters to be shipped from China. Many firewood factories are also in crisis. The reporter visited two home furnishing chain stores and found out. The firewood and sawdust here have already been sold out. Youdan, a citizen of Hanover who did not buy firewood, was a little disappointed. He told reporters that he wanted to prevent insufficient heating in autumn and winter and avoid freezing. He has replaced the natural gas heating system with a fireplace. In addition to cutting off sources, the city of Hannover is also opening up rivers. As an alternative to natural gas power generation, Germany's first hard coal power plant, the Mehrum power plant located near Hannover, recently ended its ""reserve status"" and resumed power generation. Faber, the general manager of the power plant, said frankly that the power plant is not yet able to operate at full capacity. ""The current situation of the power plant is comparable to a car that has been parked in a garage for eight months. It is not sure whether it can be restarted."" The Mehrum power plant can provide electricity for 500,000 households, but the power plant serves the entire state of Lower Saxony and cannot really solve the energy crisis in Hannover. According to data from the German Federal Network Agency, natural gas power generation accounted for 11.2% of Germany's power generation in June. Coal-fired power plants in the German states of Saarland and North Rhine-Westphalia will also be connected to the grid. Hannover Mayor Belit Onai emphasized that the city hopes to promote the use of renewable energy. The city of Hannover and the state government of Niederssen have rented solar roofs from the Hannover-based energy supplier enercity to install on the roofs of hundreds of buildings. By 2025, it will generate more than 15 gigawatt hours of electricity - enough to power 6,200 homes. European countries are trying to save money at the expense of their own citizens. Russian Satellite News Agency reported on August 1 that Russian energy expert Dmitry Gusev said that the EUs decision was not calculated. Its unwise. They havent calculated what will happen if people take less showers? Thats a health issue. Or what will happen if people have increased cardiovascular disease without air conditioning? If people stop traveling, the retail industry What will happen? ""The shadow of recession is approaching. As Europe's largest economy, Germany, under heavy pressure, may have already fallen into recession. According to data from the European Statistical Office, compared with the first quarter of this year, Germany's GDP growth rate in the second quarter was 0%, lower than the 0.1% growth expected by economists. Looking at two decimal places, the country's GDP index actually shrank by 0.04%. Economists at Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank predict the German economy will contract quarterly from the second half of the year until at least the spring. ""Deutsche Welle"" reported on August 1 that due to the impact of high inflation, the new coronavirus epidemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Germany's retail trade turnover ended the first half of this year with the largest decline in 28 years. Statistics provided by the German Federal Statistics Office that day showed that after deducting inflation factors, sales in June fell by 8.8% year-on-year. Economists predict tough times ahead for the retail industry. The Russian Satellite News Agency quoted Korneichuk, an associate professor at the Russian Government's School of Finance, as saying that the decline in Russian natural gas consumption is bringing the Eurozone economy close to recession and may have irreparable consequences for energy-intensive industries and the Eurozone economy. Enforcing restrictions on Russian gas consumption for political reasons, switching to expensive LNG, and relying on ""green"" energy will not help the European economy. As a result, the Eurozone economy is heading rapidly towards recession. Giving up Russian gas would be costly for Europeans. According to a report by Russia's ""Independent"" on August 2, Gazprom reported that global natural gas demand in the first seven months of 2022 will decrease by 35 billion cubic meters year-on-year, and the decline in EU demand is a key factor. The average price of natural gas on European exchanges rose by almost 50% in July, crossing the $1,800 per thousand cubic meter mark. TTF benchmark Dutch natural gas futures are already trading between $1,500-2,400 per thousand cubic meters, compared with less than $500 a year ago. It is the United States that stands to benefit from the crisis. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) cited CEDIGAZ data on August 1 as saying that with increased supply to Europe, the United States became the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas in the first half of 2022. The EIA said that in the first five months of this year, about 71% of U.S. LNG exports went to the European Union and the United Kingdom.",Mainland China,Global Times,,2181

According to reports, the United States is highly dependent on China for photovoltaic power generation components. Affected by U.S. sanctions against China, the photovoltaic industry supply chain is broken, making it difficult for companies to purchase Chinese products such as silicon components necessary for photovoltaic panels. Statistics from British research firm Wood Mackenzie Consulting and the US Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) show that in the United States, new installed capacity at the large utility scale will decrease by 40% in 2022, to about 10.3 million kilowatts. The installed capacity of small household solar projects increased by 37% to approximately 5.8 million kilowatts, but this was not able to fully offset the decrease. Nikkei News Network stated that this decline occurred after the United States adopted stricter trade restrictions on China under the pretext of so-called ""human rights violations."" In December 2021, the United States signed the so-called ""Prevention of Forced Uyghur Labor Act"" based on its fabricated lies about ""forced labor"" in Xinjiang. Under the law, solar panels and other critical renewable energy equipment from China will be subject to import restrictions. After the law came into effect in June last year, U.S. Customs and Border Protection unreasonably detained solar equipment imported from China in the name of ""human rights in Xinjiang,"" resulting in the detention of a large number of photovoltaic spare parts. According to Nikkei, it is estimated that nearly half of the polysilicon used in solar panels is produced in Xinjiang. Japanese media quoted industry leaders as saying that U.S. import barriers could slow down the transition to renewable energy that the Biden administration is trying to promote. Americas clean energy economy is being hampered by its own trade actions, SEIA CEO Abigail Hooper said in a statement. The solar and energy storage industries are taking decisive action to build ethical supply chains, but not Necessary supply bottlenecks and trade restrictions are preventing manufacturers from obtaining the equipment needed to invest in U.S. facilities."" Bai Ming, deputy director of the International Market Research Institute of the Ministry of Commerce Research Institute, told a reporter from the Global Times on the 3rd that the vast majority of photovoltaic modules in the world are used. Produced in China, the United States' unreasonable suppression of Chinese photovoltaic companies not only puts pressure on the operating costs of American photovoltaic companies, but is also detrimental to the development of the country's new energy industry. It is a typical practice of ""shooting oneself in the foot."" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a regular press conference in December last year that the United States formulated and implemented Xinjiang-related evil laws based on lies, seriously disrupted the normal trade of photovoltaic products between China and the United States, and seriously violated market laws and international regulations.

Not only has tritium not been removed from such nuclear-contaminated water, but it also contains radionuclides including ruthenium, strontium-90 and iodine-129. Once it enters the sea, the ecological impact in the next few decades is difficult to predict. In 2015, the Japanese government and Tokyo Electric Power Company made a written commitment that they would never discharge nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean without the understanding of fishermen and the public. Now, fishermen are demanding that nuclear-contaminated water treated by ALPS not be discharged. ""However, the Japanese government and TEPCO did not listen to the voices of the people, including those related to fisheries."" Oshima Kenichi told the Global Times reporter, ""We must insist that the (Japanese) government and TEPCO stop emissions (Nuclear contaminated) water treated by ALPS. During the conversation, Oshima Kenichi also proposed alternative methods for treating nuclear contaminated water. The first is to store water in large tanks. The half-life of tritium is 12.3 years. After 123 years of storage, the radioactivity will drop to 1/1000 of its original level. The second is mortar curing. Solidification is the process of mixing nuclear contaminated water with cement to reduce the leachability of contaminants through physical and chemical means, converting hazardous waste into an environmentally acceptable form.

The test results only need to meet certain standards.

Especially in the long run, who can endorse this question and give a firm answer? This question is a controversial one, at least in academic circles, and there is no definite answer yet. Japan cannot provide decent scientific evidence to prove that it ""will not cause any harm to humans and the environment."" However, the concerns and questions raised by some scientists are real. The discharge of Fukushima nuclear contaminated water into the sea was the first large-scale discharge of nuclear contaminated water in human history.

Although Japan's nuclear-contaminated water has been purified and diluted, it still contains tritium, which the Japanese government itself has admitted. Japan emphasizes that this radiation is very weak and will not cause harm to the ocean or human health. But many scientists don't agree with this view. For example, Greenpeace emphasizes that although tritium is a low-energy radioactive substance, it does not mean that its impact is weak, and it may cause harm once ingested by plants, animals and humans. The Chinese government has imposed import restrictions on Japanese seafood precisely out of food safety considerations. The long-term effects of tritium have not yet been clearly determined. How can we risk the safety of the food imported by the people? If the Japanese or their so-called allies are willing to sacrifice people's food security, then we have nothing to do with it.

The third pillar is to further improve and deepen the market system for carbon pricing. International experience shows that it is most effective to save energy and reduce carbon through market-oriented means and economic means. Among them, how to do a good job in the carbon market is a big article. China's national carbon market has been implemented for two years, but the industries it covers are relatively single, the overall trading volume is not active enough, and the carbon price is still relatively low. Therefore, cement, steel, petrochemicals, chemicals, non-ferrous metals, building materials, civil aviation, papermaking and other industries have been included in the market. Including it, and at the same time launching voluntary carbon emission reduction trading (CCER) to expand the capacity of the carbon market and enrich the types of transactions in the carbon market, it is particularly necessary to speed up the process. We need to see how Chinas carbon market will relate to the international carbon market, especially the benchmarking carbon market, with the implementation of the EU Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), the G7s preparations to launch a climate club and discussions on global minimum carbon pricing. The comparability of EU carbon markets is an issue that needs to be studied. The fourth pillar is how to promote energy conservation and carbon reduction at the consumer end. At present, the main work of energy conservation and carbon reduction is still aimed at industrial enterprises that are large carbon emitters, such as energy enterprises and industrial enterprises in the eight major industries that will be included in the carbon market in the future. However, with the development of the country's economy and society, carbon emissions from the consumer side, such as transportation carbon emissions, building carbon emissions, etc., will account for an increasing proportion of the country's total carbon emissions. Therefore, it is necessary to consider as soon as possible how to use carbon labels, carbon labels, etc. The majority of consumers understand the carbon emissions of various products, and through mechanisms such as information and pricing, consumers are encouraged to buy less or even no high-carbon products, forcing production to reduce carbon emissions. In addition, reducing consumers' carbon emissions through effective incentive mechanisms is also a topic that needs to be studied as soon as possible.

The world is in the midst of its first global energy crisis in more than 40 years: electricity prices in Europe are ridiculously high, factories have closed, governments have drawn up blackout plans, and Ukrainians are shivering at home. It would be easy to blame the energy turmoil on the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The Kremlin has slashed gas exports to punish European aid to Ukraine, and Western countries are boycotting Russian oil. But in reality, this energy crisis has been years in the making, in part because energy transition policies have ignored societys reliance on traditional fuels. While global leaders continue to propose more ambitious goals to divest from fossil fuels, the main issue in 2022 will still be concerns about lack of access to fossil fuels. U.S. President Joe Biden has urged OPEC to increase oil production while Europe scrambles for natural gas. Germany, once the world's model for the green energy transition, is switching to coal to replace Russian natural gas and zero-carbon nuclear power, putting the country on a higher emissions path for the second year in a row. Given that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine continues, and that Western countries are still trying to get rid of their dependence on Russian oil and natural gas, few people believe that the global energy crisis will be greatly alleviated in 2023, and the future will be a bumpy journey. The Russia-Ukraine conflict marks the beginning of a new era of geopolitically driven energy insecurity and resource competition. This has pushed climate issues down the priority list. Now, as winter sets in, Europe is heading off a cliff. Dont blame Moscow for Europes energy crisis. Instead, Europeans are facing the consequences of 20 years of wrong policies. This crisis is the responsibility of European policymakers, while making themselves dependent on Russia while trying to phase out coal and ignoring continued demand for traditional energy sources such as oil and gas. Across the Atlantic, the United States has become ""energy independent"" and has become the world's largest oil producer, but it turns out that no matter how much oil your country produces, some geopolitical shocks are inevitable. While alternative energy sources may eventually reduce demand for Saudi oil, that will happen over the next few decades, not in one or two presidential terms.

He launched the ""Voluntary Human Extinction"" movement, advocating that humans should stop reproduction and use adoption instead of reproduction; he He believes that overpopulation will lead to climate change and resource depletion, and the earth will eventually be destroyed, so his slogan is ""Thank you for not having children."" Knight's ""Voluntary Human Extinction"" movement may only be classified as an anecdote, but Knight's concerns about the world's population explosion do need to be taken seriously. The United Nations recently reported that the global population has exceeded the 8 billion mark in mid-November. A baby girl born in Manila, Philippines, is regarded as a symbol of the world's 8 billionth population. The countries with the largest population are currently in Asia. The first place is China, followed by India. It is expected that by around 2058, the population will exceed 10 billion. The sight of the population exceeding the earth's capacity reminds me of the Pixar cartoon ""Wall-E"". The movie is set in the year 2805. The earth has been filled with garbage. Humans who have already immigrated to other planets have sent robots back to the earth to clean up the garbage. It was a world with no vegetation and dense dust. The robot WALL-E worked diligently amidst the endless garbage. Later, it met another robot, Eve, and a romantic love story developed between the ""two machines"". But from another perspective, as described in Zhang Ailing's novel ""Love in a Fallen City"", ""the fall of a city fulfilled their love""; the love of this little robot couple sprouted on the destroyed earth. , quite sad and sighing. At this years United Nations Climate Change Conference, countries are still unwilling to make commitments on carbon reduction; it is too difficult to hope that selfish humans will awaken. American technology tycoons Musk and Bezos have already launched a space program to land on Mars. As humans prepare to immigrate to Mars, they are obviously pessimistic about the future of the earth.

Runtai: The environmental bureau reported the leakage of the burst pipe of waste liquid treatment and asked the operators to clean up the environment. Desheng Creek, Hukou Township, Hsinchu County yesterday morning After being polluted, the stream turned blue, fish died suddenly, and a strong pungent smell emitted. Wu Shujun, head of Hukou Township, led a team to trace the line; because the pollution site is located at the junction of Zhuxian and Taoshi, Taoshi, The Zhu County Environmental Protection Bureau initiated cross-county and city cooperation and jointly investigated with the North District Center of the Environmental Management Agency of the Ministry of Environment and determined that the blue pollution was discharged from the closed Runtai Global Bayberry Textile Factory. The Taoyuan City Environmental Protection Bureau followed Article 1 of the Water Pollution Prevention and Control Law. Thirty reports can result in a fine of not less than NT$30,000 but not more than NT$3 million, and operators are required to respond urgently by pumping out blue wastewater and cleaning up dead fish. A spokesperson surnamed Li from Runtai Global stated that Yangmei Textile Factory closed down operations as early as April 2019. There was dye waste liquid and sludge in the abandoned sewage treatment plant in the factory area. The company entrusted Formosa Energy Technology Company to handle the waste hydrolysis. Related projects are listed and are currently being applied for. Yesterday, a wastewater overflow occurred in the wastewater pool in the factory. The company will strengthen supervision of manufacturers to take responsibility and require the waste liquid to be pumped out first to speed up the application process to avoid similar pollution from happening again. Wu Shujun, head of Hukou Township, said that after receiving a report from the village's neighbor chief yesterday morning that the Desheng Creek under the Zhongshan North Bridge was contaminated with ""blue"", he immediately worked with the public office team to investigate. When they arrived at the scene, they found that not only had the creek turned blue, but the fish had died violently. It also emits a strong pungent smell, polluting the stream flowing from Xinfeng's jurisdiction to its outlet. Because a few residents in the lower reaches of Desheng Creek still drink well water, the residents were so angry that they scolded the dishonest business owners for having no conscience! After tracing the line, it was confirmed that the blue pollution was discharged from the sewage equipment of Runtai Yangmei Factory. The color and taste of the water were the same. Factory personnel said that the sewage leaked due to a broken pipe. Xiao Hongjie, the environmental protection director of Zhuxian County Government, said that after investigation, Runtai Yangmei Factory has ceased operations. During the operation yesterday, the outsourcing company originally planned to pump the wastewater from the sedimentation tank to the coagulation tank for temporary storage.

Runtai: The environmental bureau reported the leakage of the burst pipe of waste liquid treatment and asked the operators to clean up the environment. Desheng Creek, Hukou Township, Hsinchu County yesterday morning After being polluted, the stream turned blue, fish died suddenly, and a strong pungent smell emitted. Wu Shujun, head of Hukou Township, led a team to trace the line; because the pollution site is located at the junction of Zhuxian and Taoshi, Taoshi, The Zhu County Environmental Protection Bureau initiated cross-county and city cooperation and jointly investigated with the North District Center of the Environmental Management Agency of the Ministry of Environment and determined that the blue pollution was discharged from the closed Runtai Global Bayberry Textile Factory. The Taoyuan City Environmental Protection Bureau followed Article 1 of the Water Pollution Prevention and Control Law. Thirty reports can result in a fine of not less than NT$30,000 but not more than NT$3 million, and operators are required to respond urgently by pumping out blue wastewater and cleaning up dead fish. A spokesperson surnamed Li from Runtai Global stated that Yangmei Textile Factory closed down operations as early as April 2019.

Consumers can return them within three days, free of charge or only need to pay a small deposit. They can also rent from one place and return them to another. The new system will be implemented on New Year's Day.

Wang Yuebin, executive secretary of the Resource Recycling Management Committee of the Environmental Protection Department, said that in order to eliminate public concerns about the cleanliness of recycling cups, the Environmental Protection Department has formulated the ""Good Service Guidelines for Recycling (Lending) Cups"".

The store manager surnamed Shen of the FamilyMart Taoyuan City store said that the recirculating cup is very convenient, but during the COVID-19 epidemic, most consumers are worried that the recirculating cup will not be cleaned properly, so it maintains an average of double digits of customers every day and most of them are regular customers. . Last year, the Taipei City Environmental Protection Bureau began to launch a self-service recycling cup system in business districts such as mansions and station fronts. It was criticized by lawmakers and revealed that the number of users per month is less than 2,000, and about 80% of the people have concerns about health and safety. Mr. Chen, an office worker, said that he tried the recirculating cup but gave up because he was worried about hygiene issues. The man surnamed Shi believed that the recirculating cup has not been widely used in cooperative stores and can only be used in specific areas, which is inconvenient.

Women can also shine in scientific research! Lin Liqiong, a distinguished researcher at the Condensed State Science Research Center of National Taiwan University, was elected as a new academician of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Group. Her research fields are mostly in semiconductors, optoelectronics and energy materials, and she has research cooperation with many countries. She has been invited to speak at important international academic conferences, which has greatly enhanced Taiwan's visibility in the international academic community. Lin Liqiong originally developed her career in the United States, but was enthusiastically called by Li Yuanzhe, the former president of Academia Sinica, and decided to return to Taiwan to research and teach. Regarding this academic path, she is particularly grateful to her husband Chen Guixian (former director of the Academia Sinica branch) for his support along the way. Their personalities complement each other and balance. In addition, Lin Liqiong has long been committed to promoting women to study physics. She believes that physics is not difficult at all and is full of life. Therefore, she must stand up as a female scientist and tell the public: ""Doing scientific research will not become green-faced and fanged."" She hopes that young people will invest. When talking about the research field, Lin Liqiong's eyes lit up and she said that ""artificial photosynthesis"" is her current favorite, which means converting carbon dioxide into hydrocarbons through artificial photosynthesis.

 One roommate loved to eat unhealthful foods: fried everything.
 On a saturday night, he said that we should break out his electric deep frier.
 The other three of us fried some chicken, onions, and even pickles.
 He came in later (was playing Call of Duty) and ate some of our food we cooked, but no big deal.
 Later that night the three of us made a bonfire in the back yard, and he went back upstairs to play more CoD.
 About two hours after we ate, he came outside and told us to come in and clean his deep frier.
 He was angry that we hadn't already cleaned it, sparking an argument over who was responsible for what (he did invite us to use it, and he ate our food).
 It escalated to him yelling at me, and then verbal threats.
 I tried to talk him down and go in my room, and his response was to throw two kitchen knives at me.
 Both stuck in the wall behind me.

 That's a long way of saying that this is probably going to get buried, and really, I kind of hope it does, but at the same time I also want to tell this story, finally.
 To finally get it off of my chest, even if it is to a bunch of people who could meet me on the street and never know.
 It's important to tell, I think, because a lot of the posters I've seen here have been very matter of fact about some of the horrific things that they have done.
 That's not a judgement on them, at all.
 Most everything I have read here has been, in one lens or another justified.
 But very few people have admitted feeling any guilt, or even any shock at what they did.
 For me, it's totally different.
 I don't feel guilty about what I did.
 I sleep soundly every night, and while I rarely think about the events that happened that day, the thing that always sticks with me, the thing that will never go away, is not what I did, but what I found in myself that day.
 I found a brutality that I never knew existed, and now I wonder and wonder about everyone I meet... do they have it in them also, or is something wrong with me?
 I'm guilty of murder.
 Although I was never caught, and at this point, I highly doubt that I will be, I'm going to be very vague surrounding a lot of the details, just in case.
 It was the summer after I graduated high school, in a state in the Southern United States that has a lot of mountains further in from the coast.
 I lived in a town of medium size, maybe twenty thousand people or so, and on the edge of the town, the outskirts of it backed up to a very large forest that stood at the foot of a mountain.
 My parents had a house that backed up to the woods, and I grew up in those woods, walking them, both with myself and with my friends.
 So, this day, my parents are in town and I decided to go for a walk, which really was a pretty normal experience.
 It was kind of overcast, I think, which made it actually nice to be outside as opposed to the normally oppressive heat of the South.
 I don't remember why I had the knife with me.
 I know for a fact that there wasn't any certain reason for it, other than that I normally took it with me when I went into the woods as a kid, probably because I was always dreaming about being in a survival situation every time I walked back there, even though, at its furthest point, I would have been less than three miles from home (you know how imaginative kids are), but I had stopped doing that probably two years before.
 But for whatever reason, I took it with me that day.
 The trail was really wide in most places, and while the woods weren't the most common place for people to go, it wasn't exactly uncommon to pass people while you were walking it.
 Not everytime, certainly, but maybe every other.
 That's why I wasn't really surprised when I saw him walking towards me.
 The only thing that I remember thinking curious was that I knew he lived on the other side of town, and I couldn't imagine what he was doing in ""my"" woods.
 It was a kid that I went to school with, a kid that had graduated with me just a couple of weeks before.
 We went to a private school, one affiliated with a certain church, and while most of us were pretty ambivalent about the whole thing, this kid, probably because of his family, was REALLY into Jesus.
 So we stopped and I asked him what he was doing out there, and we chatted for a few minutes and then, not really being too interested in him or anything he had to say, I tried to end the conversation.
 Only he didn't want to.
 He kept tying me back into conversation, asking if I had heard this or that.
 Finally, he looks at me straight faced and says, I'll never forget this, ""Jesus went into the wilderness and I bet all he wanted was for someone to suck his bone.
 ""
 
 I was floored.
 We hadn't mentioned religion at this point, and we definitely hadn't brought up sex, and out of his mouth comes this fucking thing.
 ""Great,"" I said, and I turned and walked away.
 I was hurrying along when I felt him reach out and grab my shoulder.
 ""You hear what I said?
 "" he asked.
 I took off, running.
 Like an idiot, I didn't turn and run back towards my house, but I ran further down the path, deeper into the woods.
 He was right behind me, the whole time screaming about someone sucking his bone like Jesus.
 I should mention, probably should have mentioned earlier, but whatever; I wasn't really an in shape kid.
 I walked a lot, I loved the woods, but I wasn't the kind of person to go running, you know?
 So anyway, this kid, who was a lot faster than me, caught up to me pretty quick and tackled me.
 Knocked me off my balance, I think is probably a better description, but in either case, I went down, and I went down pretty hard.
 At this point, he had stopped screaming about Jesus and his bone and whatever had gone really quiet.
 I wanted to scream at him and ask him what the fuck was wrong with him, if he was on drugs or something (I later found out his family had a history of psychological issues, and there were rumors that he had molested his sister), but I had the wind knocked out of me.

 A few days before the wedding, my mother, sister-in-law (Caitlyn), her mother (controlling alcoholic bitch), and I went out to look for the perfect veil.
 Keep in mind, my sister-in-law has never concerned herself with fashion; she's more of a MST3K t-shirt, jeans, and converse girl.
 So shopping is really never her thing.
 But this was very special to her and she wanted to make the right choice.
 She knew that we were likely going to have to drive to Texarkana (hour away) where there were more options, but she wanted to give the local shops a fair try.
 Her mother suggested a little Mexican shop around the corner that sold bridal accessories.
 We go check it out and she finds nothing of interest, but her mother does.
 She takes down a veil that pretty much feels and smells like velvet that's been dragged through curdles of milk and dried in the sun for hours-- the fibers were all crunchy and it smelled like shit.
 She practically shoves it in my Caitlyn's face and tells her she's going get this.
 My sister being the push-over she is meekly agreed and walked to to the till.
 I pulled her aside and managed to talk her out of it and suggested we go check out the other places before she makes a decision.
 She told her mom that she wanted to go to Texarkana and the bitch exploded in fury.
 She went on about how she doesn't have the money to pay for the veil AND gas, blah, blah, blah.
 Eventually my mother steps in and offers to drive her vehicle.
 K, we're good now.
 We get to Texarkana, Caitlyn finds her perfect veil for about 100 bucks, and her mom once again freaks about how she's not sure if she has the money in her bank.
 So, I pay for it.
 No big deal to me.
 Afterwards we head out for lunch and do a little shopping.
 We end up in  a Victoria's Secret, and after calling my mother a hefer (my mother used to be overweight), the bitch ends up buying a few bottles of perfume and a bra that totals waaaay over 100 bucks.
 I could see the hurt in my Caitlyn's eyes, but being the fuckin' champ she is, she held her head high and swore to not let anything bring her special day down.
 Fast-forward to the morning of the wedding day.
 My sister had her zombie cake made by a friend about 1.5 hours away.
 She enlisted in her younger sister (18 years old, starved for attention) to drive and get the cake.
 Not such a hard task, right?
 Few hours later we're sitting on the front porch smokin' a bowl and pumping ourselves up for an awesome day when Caitlyn's sister comes barreling around a stop sign and whips into the long driveway like a goddamn maniac.
 It was pretty obvious the cake didn't make it.
 Sure enough, we open the box and you can't even tell if that's a cake or mashed potatoes.
 Even then, Caitlyn didn't go Bridezilla on her sister-- which would have been entirely understandable.
 She walked inside the house, cried for a bit, then came back out with a smile.
 Of course in the meantime my brother was ripping the sister a new one, and boy was it fun to watch.
 There were quite a few other events that really made me sick to my stomach and sympathize for my poor sister-in-law.
 She had to kick her mother out of the rehearsal for being drunk and obnoxious, for one.
 But karma surely made it's way around because the old coot got a DUI the day after the wedding.
 Serves her right, especially for calling my mama a hefer!

 A few days before the wedding, my mother, sister-in-law (Caitlyn), her mother (controlling alcoholic bitch), and I went out to look for the perfect veil.
 Keep in mind, my sister-in-law has never concerned herself with fashion; she's more of a MST3K t-shirt, jeans, and converse girl.
 So shopping is really never her thing.
 But this was very special to her and she wanted to make the right choice.
 She knew that we were likely going to have to drive to Texarkana (hour away) where there were more options, but she wanted to give the local shops a fair try.
 Her mother suggested a little Mexican shop around the corner that sold bridal accessories.
 We go check it out and she finds nothing of interest, but her mother does.
 She takes down a veil that pretty much feels and smells like velvet that's been dragged through curdles of milk and dried in the sun for hours-- the fibers were all crunchy and it smelled like shit.
 She practically shoves it in my Caitlyn's face and tells her she's going get this.
 My sister being the push-over she is meekly agreed and walked to to the till.
 I pulled her aside and managed to talk her out of it and suggested we go check out the other places before she makes a decision.
 She told her mom that she wanted to go to Texarkana and the bitch exploded in fury.
 She went on about how she doesn't have the money to pay for the veil AND gas, blah, blah, blah.
 Eventually my mother steps in and offers to drive her vehicle.
 K, we're good now.
 We get to Texarkana, Caitlyn finds her perfect veil for about 100 bucks, and her mom once again freaks about how she's not sure if she has the money in her bank.
 So, I pay for it.
 No big deal to me.
 Afterwards we head out for lunch and do a little shopping.
 We end up in  a Victoria's Secret, and after calling my mother a hefer (my mother used to be overweight), the bitch ends up buying a few bottles of perfume and a bra that totals waaaay over 100 bucks.
 I could see the hurt in my Caitlyn's eyes, but being the fuckin' champ she is, she held her head high and swore to not let anything bring her special day down.
 Fast-forward to the morning of the wedding day.
 My sister had her zombie cake made by a friend about 1.5 hours away.
 She enlisted in her younger sister (18 years old, starved for attention) to drive and get the cake.
 Not such a hard task, right?
 Few hours later we're sitting on the front porch smokin' a bowl and pumping ourselves up for an awesome day when Caitlyn's sister comes barreling around a stop sign and whips into the long driveway like a goddamn maniac.
 It was pretty obvious the cake didn't make it.
 Sure enough, we open the box and you can't even tell if that's a cake or mashed potatoes.
 Even then, Caitlyn didn't go Bridezilla on her sister-- which would have been entirely understandable.
 She walked inside the house, cried for a bit, then came back out with a smile.
 Of course in the meantime my brother was ripping the sister a new one, and boy was it fun to watch.
 There were quite a few other events that really made me sick to my stomach and sympathize for my poor sister-in-law.
 She had to kick her mother out of the rehearsal for being drunk and obnoxious, for one.
 But karma surely made it's way around because the old coot got a DUI the day after the wedding.
 Serves her right, especially for calling my mama a hefer!

 So she doesn't say anything but she's cracking up and goes upstairs to tell my dad to tell him to wake his ass up before I woke up because i would get excited and jump on him to wake him up  (Paul was a super cool guy to me as a kid and we still hangout when my parents invite him over).
 So my dad goes down and sees this and is like DUDE?!?

 We decided we weren't ready or mature enough for children  ( I was 21 she was 20) so we decided on an abortion.
 We discussed it and came easily to the conclusion that we would never tell anyone and it was our secret.
 Fast forward several weeks and she and I become more and more distant and we decide to break it off.
 We were no longer living together, and neither of us were happy.
 So the breakup seemed like it was going to actually go well.
 However, I always felt guilty regarding the abortion.
 She would use this several times over the next year or so as an excuse if she needed a ride or needed help with something.
 We'd still hook up occasionally but definitely not back to being in a relationship.
 We had a large group of mutual friends, who were her friends first.
 I stayed away from them for a while until almost all of them called me and said they didn't care that we broke up they still want to be friends.
 Now, the whole using the abortion against me was taking a bit of a toll on my for the guilt I felt regarding the whole situation.
 One of our mutual friends, who was both my and hers closest friend at the time, decided to tell me the truth.
 Apparently the ENTIRE time we were dating she had been cheating on me.
 Mostly with friends of ours or with her ex's and a few times with other guys she knew.
 She wound up cheating on me and getting pregnant by that guy, but when she told him what happened, he changed his phone number and joined the Navy.
 (yeah she was that crazy).
 So instead she told me it was mine, knowing   I had never before suspected her to be a cheater, but when she had told me about the pregnancy I distinctly asked her if she had been with anyone else, which she said no.
 So I found out 4 of my friends knew but thought I would be better off without knowing the baby wasn't mine.
 Since I was being made a fool of by her, I decided to confront her in front of people.
 I asked her when she walked into the house we were all in ""Who's baby was it?
 Cause I know it wasn't mine""   
 
 She admitted to everything, albeit we had gone outside at the time because frankly, outing her in front of everyone was enough satisfaction.
 in the two years we were together, she cheated on me with at least 20 different guys.
 She couldn't even remember half of their names.
 None of us saw her for several months, I didn't go around blabbing about it, and several friends came up after they heard about it and told me they hooked up with her.
 She had been telling every guy who knew me that we had broken up and they all believed her or didnt care.
 Fast forward again several months, I walk into a party that she is at and shes telling this girl how her ""Ex boyfriend forced her to get an abortion against her will""  I told the entire party very loudly exactly what transpired between us, and I realized that she is just frankly crazy.
 there were dozens of more examples of lies and deceit, Will answer any questions.

 We discussed it and came easily to the conclusion that we would never tell anyone and it was our secret.
 Fast forward several weeks and she and I become more and more distant and we decide to break it off.
 We were no longer living together, and neither of us were happy.
 So the breakup seemed like it was going to actually go well.
 However, I always felt guilty regarding the abortion.
 She would use this several times over the next year or so as an excuse if she needed a ride or needed help with something.
 We'd still hook up occasionally but definitely not back to being in a relationship.
 We had a large group of mutual friends, who were her friends first.
 I stayed away from them for a while until almost all of them called me and said they didn't care that we broke up they still want to be friends.
 Now, the whole using the abortion against me was taking a bit of a toll on my for the guilt I felt regarding the whole situation.
 One of our mutual friends, who was both my and hers closest friend at the time, decided to tell me the truth.
 Apparently the ENTIRE time we were dating she had been cheating on me.
 Mostly with friends of ours or with her ex's and a few times with other guys she knew.
 She wound up cheating on me and getting pregnant by that guy, but when she told him what happened, he changed his phone number and joined the Navy.
 (yeah she was that crazy).
 So instead she told me it was mine, knowing   I had never before suspected her to be a cheater, but when she had told me about the pregnancy I distinctly asked her if she had been with anyone else, which she said no.
 So I found out 4 of my friends knew but thought I would be better off without knowing the baby wasn't mine.
 Since I was being made a fool of by her, I decided to confront her in front of people.
 I asked her when she walked into the house we were all in ""Who's baby was it?
 Cause I know it wasn't mine""   
 
 She admitted to everything, albeit we had gone outside at the time because frankly, outing her in front of everyone was enough satisfaction.
 in the two years we were together, she cheated on me with at least 20 different guys.
 She couldn't even remember half of their names.
 None of us saw her for several months, I didn't go around blabbing about it, and several friends came up after they heard about it and told me they hooked up with her.
 She had been telling every guy who knew me that we had broken up and they all believed her or didnt care.
 Fast forward again several months, I walk into a party that she is at and shes telling this girl how her ""Ex boyfriend forced her to get an abortion against her will""  I told the entire party very loudly exactly what transpired between us, and I realized that she is just frankly crazy.
 there were dozens of more examples of lies and deceit, Will answer any questions.

 I was 21 when she passed but still living at home with my mom.
 Anyways, for a period lasting about 1-2 weeks after my grandmother passed, weird shit happened at our place and my grandfather's place, which was literally right across from our apartment.
 Like you walk outside our apartment, and 5 feet across is my grandparent's apartment.
 Me and my mom would be hanging out in the livingroom watching TV and the light in the kitchen would turn on and then a few seconds later flick back off.
 This happened most often.
 A couple times one or more of the cabinets would be open.
 One morning my grandfather came over and asked if we had come over to borrow a roll of toilet paper.
 We had barely just woken up (it was like 7 AM when he came to talk to us) and we hadn't been over to my grandfather's place since lunch the day prior.
 He said he woke up and when he walked into the hallway, the linen closet (where they store the toilet paper) was wide open and there was a roll of toilet paper on the bar.

 Under the table 50 hours a week.
 Open to close person.
 Getting paud 7.25 a hour .
 One day ,on payday, I went next door to get some chicken wings at the local billards.
 I stupidly drop 100 dollar bill in there through my apron.
 Immediately I noticed  I went back to ask/look for it.
 (foolish young hopes) the man that worked there witness a man that found 100 bill with his pre teenager.
 The man was regular customer.
 He goes in there everyday.
 Behind all of this there was man witnessing everything that happened.
 An island dark skinned man with long dreads was at my bakery early the day I got paid, played pool the time I placed my order for the wings , to when I came back looking for my money, finally to the next day where he was there again.
 He asked if the man ever returned money that he saw him back in billards that night and told him that the money was mine I dropped it.
 The man said hell being it to me tomorrow.
 I told him no he not come in he said he was sorry .
 I finished his order.
 He slipped 100 dollars and I was refusing to take it .
 He wouldn't take it back he said something about morals and how people should thrir children nice vales.
 See that second that man I left I never saw him again.
 The moment he left I thought I knew he was a angel .
 Really to me a angel.
 His aura his vibe was so sweet true heartily.
 His face is forever in graves in my head.
 The man from billards never saw him again.

 She had already put the kids to bed, and decided to watch TV for the next few hours until the parents got home.
 The TV was at the back of the house, connecting to the kitchen at the right side of the room and to the dining room at the back.
 There was a large window above the TV.
 As she's watching a random program, she sees something move outside the window.
 She squints to get a better look outside and sees a man standing in the backyard.
 That's all, he's just standing there, staring inside.
 Completely still.
 She gets worried, but knowing that people often cut through the backyard (the house is between two busy streets) she casts it off as a random crazy.
 About ten minutes later, he's still there, so she calls the police.
 The police knock on the door a few minutes later, and she cuts through the kitchen to the front of the house.
 As soon as she openend the door, the police officer immediately became alarmed, drawing his gun and yelling at her to get out of the way.
 As she turned around to let him past she tried to explain that, no, he was outside.
 However, before she could finish, the officer grabs a man standing in the living room.
 The man was never outside.
 He was standing behind the couch in the dining room, staring at her.

 She had already put the kids to bed, and decided to watch TV for the next few hours until the parents got home.
 The TV was at the back of the house, connecting to the kitchen at the right side of the room and to the dining room at the back.
 There was a large window above the TV.
 As she's watching a random program, she sees something move outside the window.
 She squints to get a better look outside and sees a man standing in the backyard.
 That's all, he's just standing there, staring inside.
 Completely still.
 She gets worried, but knowing that people often cut through the backyard (the house is between two busy streets) she casts it off as a random crazy.
 About ten minutes later, he's still there, so she calls the police.
 The police knock on the door a few minutes later, and she cuts through the kitchen to the front of the house.
 As soon as she openend the door, the police officer immediately became alarmed, drawing his gun and yelling at her to get out of the way.
 As she turned around to let him past she tried to explain that, no, he was outside.
 However, before she could finish, the officer grabs a man standing in the living room.
 The man was never outside.
 He was standing behind the couch in the dining room, staring at her.

 I was once talking about this with a friend, a Catholic Mexican, and she was almost shocked at this because her mom listens to this Catholic radio station of which they were discussing this EXACT FUCKING THING.

 Apparently Area 51 is basically an intergalactic embassy, but that's not the point.
 The point of interest here was when in the '50s, an alien being volunteered to be interviewed.
 They don't speak, but communicate through telepathy so the researchers at Area 51 needed the best people who could communicate through telepathy.
 Apparently, these alien beings (I'd presume especially the Nordics) are incredibly spiritual beings.
 They don't fear death, and it seems they believe in reincarnation.
 The body is literally just a vessel for the soul, and technology is only used to make the body more efficient.
 I bet what you experienced was a highly spiritual phenomenon.
 As you said, what happened to you was during a dream like state, your soul could have left your body (mostly your head) and encountered these beings or the beings could have beckoned your soul.
