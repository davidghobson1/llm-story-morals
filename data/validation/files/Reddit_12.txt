I use to work in an Italian bakery not too long ago.
 Under the table 50 hours a week.
 Open to close person.
 Getting paud 7.25 a hour .
 One day ,on payday, I went next door to get some chicken wings at the local billards.
 I stupidly drop 100 dollar bill in there through my apron.
 Immediately I noticed  I went back to ask/look for it.
 (foolish young hopes) the man that worked there witness a man that found 100 bill with his pre teenager.
 The man was regular customer.
 He goes in there everyday.
 Behind all of this there was man witnessing everything that happened.
 An island dark skinned man with long dreads was at my bakery early the day I got paid, played pool the time I placed my order for the wings , to when I came back looking for my money, finally to the next day where he was there again.
 He asked if the man ever returned money that he saw him back in billards that night and told him that the money was mine I dropped it.
 The man said hell being it to me tomorrow.
 I told him no he not come in he said he was sorry .
 I finished his order.
 He slipped 100 dollars and I was refusing to take it .
 He wouldn't take it back he said something about morals and how people should thrir children nice vales.
 See that second that man I left I never saw him again.
 The moment he left I thought I knew he was a angel .
 Really to me a angel.
 His aura his vibe was so sweet true heartily.
 His face is forever in graves in my head.
 The man from billards never saw him again.
 His son still fgoes to the billards with his uncle
