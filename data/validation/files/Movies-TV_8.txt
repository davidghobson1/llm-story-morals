Open with Neal being taken away in a van. His anklet is tosses into another vehicle. Peter's team storms into Neal's apartment looking for him. They find it empty, but Mozzie wanders in with a body double, clearly about to start planning something with Neal. Peter questions Mozzie at the station. Mozzie is adamant Neal hasn't left, in large part because he would have gone with Mozzie. They realize somebody must have taken him. We see Neal has been brought to an abandoned building and is cuffed to a chair. He's being held by Booth, Rebecca's former associate. He wants Neal to help him steal the diamond from the feds. Booth says he doesn't want to sell it. Booth's phone rings. As Mozzie walks out he sees Rebecca being brought in. Mozzie wants to help interrogate her but Peter isn't having it. Neal manages to get a screw out of the back of his chair, but he doesn't pick his cuffs. Neal overhears Booth on the phone. He references Woodruff, the head of the Pink Panthers. Booth wants to join the Panthers, but he needs to steal something impressive to get the invite. Since he's seen their faces, if he doesn't get into the group he'll be killed. Neal says he'll help him steal something else. Peter asks Rebecca to tell him who has Neal. He talks to her about the fact he chose Neal and "what's right" over going to DC with his wife. He says he knows she loves Neal and thinks she'll help him. Neal suggests the way to go is to try and steal from Woodford himself in order to impress the Panthers. Booth says Wooford's in town, working out of the Kessman Building. As a show of good faith so Booth knows he can trust Neal, he convinces him they should change locations as Peter will be there any minute. It works, as they leave just before the FBI arrives. Neal's cuffs are removed and they agree to be partners. Peter finds the word "Kessman" carved on the chair Neal had been cuffed to. Mozzie realizes the building "is the kind of place you rob." We learn Kessman is owned by a who's who of the rich. Also they see via his record that Booth isn't known as a proficient thief. With Mozzie's help they figure out Neal has directed Booth to something they can steal. Between Neal and Mozzie we learn the most likely plan is to breach the Kessman during the day via its roof. The only way is to shoot an arrow from a nearby building and zip line over. Peter convinces Mozzie the only way to help Neal is to give up the likely source of the equipment Neal will need for the heist. It's someone named Fat Charlie. Peter tells Fat Charlie to disappear for 24 hours. So when Neal and Booth arrive looking for gear, Peter poses at Fat Charlie. Neal passes a secret message to Peter that the Pink Panthers are involved. At the next team meeting Peter say he thinks Neal's plan is to audition for Woodford and infiltrate the gang. Jones wonders aloud if perhaps Neal is trying to join the Panthers for real, but Peter says for the moment they'll trust Neal. Booth tells Neal he wants to join the Panthers because they're the best. Since Booth's been in the building he'll be recognized. Neal will need to be the one. Peter speaks with Elizabeth, who seems to be doing well in DC. He doesn't mention specifics about Neal. After hanging up Mozzie arrives at the door with food recommended by Elizabeth. Peter asks Mozzie to dine with him and he accepts. The heist begins and a piece of Neal's equipment breaks. He's forced to zip down using his belt. It works and Neal gets into the building, just ahead of the guard. Peter tells the team it's time to bring in Booth. But they see that Woodford has just pulled up to the building, with Neal still inside. We see Neal break into Woodford's safe and start looking through documents. Mozzie pretends to be a bicyclist who ran into Woodford's Ferrari, buying Neal enough time to get out of the office. It works. Booth disappears before Jones can grab him. Peter thinks this means Neal will now be expendable. Cut to Neal approaching Booth after the heist. Booth pulls a gun, but Peter and Diana arrive just in time. Neal tells Peter he thinks he might have just auditioned to be a member of the Pink Panthers. Neal tells Peter he'll try to infiltrate the gang so long as he has a contract promising he's allowed to leave the FBI if he brings in the gang. Neal arrives in Woodford's office. Woodford realizes that Neal successfully broke into the safe. He's impressed and Neal asks to join the Panthers. Back at the FBI Neal speaks with Rebecca before she's brought back to prison. He says he can't call things even, despite her helping him. He wants to know why she did it. Rebecca says she thinks "this is as close as we can get to a happy ending." After she leaves Neal tells Peter he can't stop thinking about how he fell for her. Outside Neal sees that Rebecca has been killed. She tried to grab a guard's gun and was shot by one of the others. Neal thinks it was likely her intention to die. Peter returns home to find Elizabeth waiting for him. She tells him she's pregnant. Neal and Mozzie talk about Rebecca and her final words. He then tells Mozzie about his deal to bring down the Panthers. Mozzie wonders how Neal can be sure the FBI will deliver on the promise of his freedom. Neal tells Mozzie: "Who says that's all I'm after."
