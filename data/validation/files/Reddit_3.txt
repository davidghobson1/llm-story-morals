The creepiest moment of my live to this day.
 Might be a little dull to you guys.
 (Especially if you haven't seen Children of the Corn.
 ) When I was 16, a group of friends and I decided to go camping in the Northern Peninsula of Michigan.
 We packed our car and headed out.
 We had found a camp ground that was in the middle of nowhere and thought that it would be great to get away from the towns and cities.
 No electronics, no bathing, just pure camping.
 We got to the camp ground and set up our sites.
 We wanted some marshmallows for the fire we were going to have and some hot dogs to roast, so me and a couple of my friends pile into my car and start to go to the town.
 (The Town Is 30 Minutes away, give or take.
 ) We arrived to the store in the little town, grabbed our stuff, and some beer.
 (Gotta Have Some High School Memories) On our back to the camp site we were passing through a lot of corn fields.
 We were on the topic of the movie Children of the Corn.
 As they were all talking, I was making a left on a rundown gravel road to the campsite by a long cornfield.
 As soon as we turned the corner we all saw a small child, maybe 9 or 10, in this old raggedy clothing and we freaked the fuck out.
 Mind you that there is no houses near this place and we are maybe 8-9 Miles away from our campground.
 We were out in the middle of butt fuck no where.
 No cars around, nothing.
 I sped up and kicked up dust behind my car.
 I got back to the camp site and we all packed our shit and left.
 We stayed in a Hotel after traveling back into the southern part of Michigan.
 To this day, that is the most creepiest, weirdest, and yet ironic thing to happen to me.
