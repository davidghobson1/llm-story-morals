Sophomore year of university, I rented a house with 3 other guys.
 One roommate loved to eat unhealthful foods: fried everything.
 On a saturday night, he said that we should break out his electric deep frier.
 The other three of us fried some chicken, onions, and even pickles.
 He came in later (was playing Call of Duty) and ate some of our food we cooked, but no big deal.
 Later that night the three of us made a bonfire in the back yard, and he went back upstairs to play more CoD.
 About two hours after we ate, he came outside and told us to come in and clean his deep frier.
 He was angry that we hadn't already cleaned it, sparking an argument over who was responsible for what (he did invite us to use it, and he ate our food).
 It escalated to him yelling at me, and then verbal threats.
 I tried to talk him down and go in my room, and his response was to throw two kitchen knives at me.
 Both stuck in the wall behind me.
 I left the house for the night, we never talked about it, and the three of us all moved out of the house about a month later.
