One of my earliest memories is watching the Mary Tyler Moore show with my dad and older brother.
 I couldn't have been more than three.
 I remember looking up and seeing a big tortoise in the hallway.
 I turned to get my dad to look but when I looked back it was gone.
 I have seen the tortoise at other points in my life - its always in some dark area of a room or dimly lit hallway and when I focus or blink my eyes it is gone.
 The last time I saw it was when I was in high school (1987)  I was in the library late after school and I saw it behind the metal gate that locked off the receptionist area.
 I fell out of my chair in surprise but when I looked up it was gone.
 I have not or do not remember seeing it since.
 I did obsess with the mystery in my 20's.
 The closest mythos was the Native American animal guide but I didn't feel any message or wasn't looking for any guidance when it appeared.
 It was just totally random.
 When I am at a zoo I see if they have any large tortoises and I usually make an excuse to slip away and go there on my own and see if anything happens.
 I am not sure if it was a hallucination but it is one of the mysteries in my life.
