Well I know I'm not a "parent" but I have some stories about my little brother that fall into this category.
 The most recent one that comes in mind is just this week I was getting ready to go out and went into the laundry room to get a freshly washed shirt for the day.
 I go in there and my brother is jerkin it with one of those fabric softener sheets.
 I kind of backed up and just went in my room for a while.
 Another one that is far worse happened maybe a year ago.
 I try not to remember it but here I am telling the world.
 I was home alone and needed take a monumental dump.
 I knew it was going to stink the whole house up so I went in my Dad's bathroom which has one of those suction vents.
 There I am taking a dump when I hear my brother come home and I can hear him telling his dog to "come here" and "go in Daddy's room".
 Now at this point I was mad because I have to hear a 10-15 or however old he is playing and giggling as I'm pushing with all my might to clear my bowels.
 Then the sounds get a little weird...
 I mean it sounded like someone was crying so I, without wiping, pull my pants up and run out of the bathroom to find my brother getting a BJ from the dog.
 I really didn't know what to do so I just left the room and went to our bathroom.
 So I ended up practiclly shitting my pants just to see my brother... you know.
 There are plenty more of these if you want to here them...
