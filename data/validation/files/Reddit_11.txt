My auntie was 38 when she got married, she was the eldest of two sisters (her sister was my mum; my mum got married when she was 22 to my dad) so she'd waited a long time for a guy to marry her (she'd been engaged three times before to three different men, each one had broken off the engagement).
 My sister was one of her bridesmaids.
 During a practice at the church, my aunt shouted at my sister for walking out of time.
 My sister was only seven at the time and to have a seriously stressed bridezilla in her face because she didn't put her foot in the right place at the right time was terrifying.
 She burst into tears and according to my mum, my aunt said, "Oh and *NOW* she's crying.
 Can you remind me how old you are?!
 " My mum was furious with her, my aunt is stubborn so for a few weeks my mum told my aunt to find a new bridesmaid.
 My aunt wouldn't budge until my grandmother eventually begged her to for the sake of the wedding.
 Even now my sister isn't fond of my aunt.
 My aunt is still extremely stressy, she has a young daughter of her own now who she treats like a queen.
 If anything happens to her, she turns into the Hulk.
