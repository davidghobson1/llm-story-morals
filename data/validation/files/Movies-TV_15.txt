Higher on Cass and Nick's priorities is dodging accusations of drug taking when DS Phil Hunter brings in their dealer. PC Jim Carver is still tasked with the unpleasant duty of being PC Tony Stamp's Family Liaison Officer.

Tony begins to doubt Jim's belief in his innocence and a covert meeting with DC Danny Glaze does nothing to improve his position. DI Alex Cullen is left fuming when the brutal murder of teenager Liz Chambers is handed over to Barton St. His anger gives way to dropping Jack Meadows a name from the superintendent's past, ex-DCI Marsden. Jack pays him a visit only to find one copper can't fool another. The road to Tom Chandler's destruction isn't as easy as they'd hoped it would be.
