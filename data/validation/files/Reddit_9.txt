A number of* years ago I was at a party, heavily liquored up, when all of a sudden a fight broke out.
 When I noticed one of my friends was getting beat up, I jumped in to save him and thus got the shit kicked out of me by a number of coked out gentlemen.
 In the midst of the chaos and between consciousness/drunkenness I managed to get the pocket knife out of my pocket and I latched on to the nearest fucker I could get my hands on, I ended up on the back of the biggest guy and I slashed across his neck.
 He made it to the hospital to get stitches and rather than press charges, declared a vendetta; the state thought differently and carried through with the charges themselves.
 They charged me with attempted manslaughter and assault with a deadly weapon.
 I took a deal and did 395 days in a medium security state penitentiary.
 I haven't seen him since but I know we both have families, lives, futures... my only hope is that he has long since forgiven me and now lives in peace.
 The only thing I regret about the whole ordeal, is that I didn't get to this thread any sooner.
