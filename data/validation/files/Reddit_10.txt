Similar things happened after my grandmother passed several years ago.
 I was 21 when she passed but still living at home with my mom.
 Anyways, for a period lasting about 1-2 weeks after my grandmother passed, weird shit happened at our place and my grandfather's place, which was literally right across from our apartment.
 Like you walk outside our apartment, and 5 feet across is my grandparent's apartment.
 Me and my mom would be hanging out in the livingroom watching TV and the light in the kitchen would turn on and then a few seconds later flick back off.
 This happened most often.
 A couple times one or more of the cabinets would be open.
 One morning my grandfather came over and asked if we had come over to borrow a roll of toilet paper.
 We had barely just woken up (it was like 7 AM when he came to talk to us) and we hadn't been over to my grandfather's place since lunch the day prior.
 He said he woke up and when he walked into the hallway, the linen closet (where they store the toilet paper) was wide open and there was a roll of toilet paper on the bar.
 When he walked around into the kitchen, some of the kitchen cabinets were also open.
 My grandma was a wonderful woman that I loved dearly, but it's kind of funny in hindsight because she was super fat so it made sense that she would be haunting the kitchens.
