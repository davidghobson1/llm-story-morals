My sister-in-law was the complete opposite of a Bridezilla, however her mother and younger sister should have had targets on their backs by the end of the wedding.
 A few days before the wedding, my mother, sister-in-law (Caitlyn), her mother (controlling alcoholic bitch), and I went out to look for the perfect veil.
 Keep in mind, my sister-in-law has never concerned herself with fashion; she's more of a MST3K t-shirt, jeans, and converse girl.
 So shopping is really never her thing.
 But this was very special to her and she wanted to make the right choice.
 She knew that we were likely going to have to drive to Texarkana (hour away) where there were more options, but she wanted to give the local shops a fair try.
 Her mother suggested a little Mexican shop around the corner that sold bridal accessories.
 We go check it out and she finds nothing of interest, but her mother does.
 She takes down a veil that pretty much feels and smells like velvet that's been dragged through curdles of milk and dried in the sun for hours-- the fibers were all crunchy and it smelled like shit.
 She practically shoves it in my Caitlyn's face and tells her she's going get this.
 My sister being the push-over she is meekly agreed and walked to to the till.
 I pulled her aside and managed to talk her out of it and suggested we go check out the other places before she makes a decision.
 She told her mom that she wanted to go to Texarkana and the bitch exploded in fury.
 She went on about how she doesn't have the money to pay for the veil AND gas, blah, blah, blah.
 Eventually my mother steps in and offers to drive her vehicle.
 K, we're good now.
 We get to Texarkana, Caitlyn finds her perfect veil for about 100 bucks, and her mom once again freaks about how she's not sure if she has the money in her bank.
 So, I pay for it.
 No big deal to me.
 Afterwards we head out for lunch and do a little shopping.
 We end up in  a Victoria's Secret, and after calling my mother a hefer (my mother used to be overweight), the bitch ends up buying a few bottles of perfume and a bra that totals waaaay over 100 bucks.
 I could see the hurt in my Caitlyn's eyes, but being the fuckin' champ she is, she held her head high and swore to not let anything bring her special day down.
 Fast-forward to the morning of the wedding day.
 My sister had her zombie cake made by a friend about 1.5 hours away.
 She enlisted in her younger sister (18 years old, starved for attention) to drive and get the cake.
 Not such a hard task, right?
 Few hours later we're sitting on the front porch smokin' a bowl and pumping ourselves up for an awesome day when Caitlyn's sister comes barreling around a stop sign and whips into the long driveway like a goddamn maniac.
 It was pretty obvious the cake didn't make it.
 Sure enough, we open the box and you can't even tell if that's a cake or mashed potatoes.
 Even then, Caitlyn didn't go Bridezilla on her sister-- which would have been entirely understandable.
 She walked inside the house, cried for a bit, then came back out with a smile.
 Of course in the meantime my brother was ripping the sister a new one, and boy was it fun to watch.
 There were quite a few other events that really made me sick to my stomach and sympathize for my poor sister-in-law.
 She had to kick her mother out of the rehearsal for being drunk and obnoxious, for one.
 But karma surely made it's way around because the old coot got a DUI the day after the wedding.
 Serves her right, especially for calling my mama a hefer!
