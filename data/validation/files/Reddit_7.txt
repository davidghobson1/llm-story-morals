This actually happened to me, so I'm going to be a little vague for the sake of privacy.
 I have never been one to give much of a fuck about things, so I used to give hitch-hikers and strangers rides if it looked like they could use it.
 One day, I'm in my driveway washing my car before I leave for class at college and I see a sketchy looking guy walking down my street.
 I don't live in the best neighborhood, and there are several bad neighborhoods pretty close by, so being wary isn't unwarranted.
 He was wearing... weird clothes.
 They looked like cheap, badly cleaned dress clothes.
 A white button-up shirt, sleeves unbuttoned, black wrinkled slacks, and a scuffed, old battered black briefcase.
 He had a shaved head, and looked scrawny, like he had been starving somewhere.
 When he got nearby, he asked if I could give him a lift, and I got a weird vibe from him, but I said sure.
 I asked where he needed to go, and he said somewhere vague and told me he would give me directions and it wasn't far.
 Asked me if I would stop at the local liquor store.
 I do, and he gets a beer and some cigarettes, and offers me both, but I decline, then take him to his destination.
 On the way there he explains that today was his first day out of jail after having served three years.
 I didn't know what to say so I congratulated him and he thanked me and swigged on his beer.
 Destination was a well-known hangout for gang members right on the edge of an especially bad neighborhood.
 I pull in, and drop him off, and he thanks me and leaves.
 Now... about 5 years later, I see him again.
 Same guy, impossible to mistake him.
 He still looked the same, only... like he had been fed better.
 Less scrawny.
 He was on the witness stand at a murder trial.
 A murder that took place at the very place I dropped him off, about three weeks later.
 Chances are good that he stayed there from the time I dropped him off and never left.
 He testified against the people who did the murder.
 They were gang members, part of a gang he was a member of before he went to jail.
 He has lived in hiding since the trial.
 The person murdered would have been a member of my family through marriage if he hadn't been murdered.
 He was the only person to testify against them.
 I had goosebumps during the entire trial the day he testified.
