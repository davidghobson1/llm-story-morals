My ex girlfriend got pregnant.
 We decided we weren't ready or mature enough for children  ( I was 21 she was 20) so we decided on an abortion.
 We discussed it and came easily to the conclusion that we would never tell anyone and it was our secret.
 Fast forward several weeks and she and I become more and more distant and we decide to break it off.
 We were no longer living together, and neither of us were happy.
 So the breakup seemed like it was going to actually go well.
 However, I always felt guilty regarding the abortion.
 She would use this several times over the next year or so as an excuse if she needed a ride or needed help with something.
 We'd still hook up occasionally but definitely not back to being in a relationship.
 We had a large group of mutual friends, who were her friends first.
 I stayed away from them for a while until almost all of them called me and said they didn't care that we broke up they still want to be friends.
 Now, the whole using the abortion against me was taking a bit of a toll on my for the guilt I felt regarding the whole situation.
 One of our mutual friends, who was both my and hers closest friend at the time, decided to tell me the truth.
 Apparently the ENTIRE time we were dating she had been cheating on me.
 Mostly with friends of ours or with her ex's and a few times with other guys she knew.
 She wound up cheating on me and getting pregnant by that guy, but when she told him what happened, he changed his phone number and joined the Navy.
 (yeah she was that crazy).
 So instead she told me it was mine, knowing   I had never before suspected her to be a cheater, but when she had told me about the pregnancy I distinctly asked her if she had been with anyone else, which she said no.
 So I found out 4 of my friends knew but thought I would be better off without knowing the baby wasn't mine.
 Since I was being made a fool of by her, I decided to confront her in front of people.
 I asked her when she walked into the house we were all in "Who's baby was it?
 Cause I know it wasn't mine"   
 
 She admitted to everything, albeit we had gone outside at the time because frankly, outing her in front of everyone was enough satisfaction.
 in the two years we were together, she cheated on me with at least 20 different guys.
 She couldn't even remember half of their names.
 None of us saw her for several months, I didn't go around blabbing about it, and several friends came up after they heard about it and told me they hooked up with her.
 She had been telling every guy who knew me that we had broken up and they all believed her or didnt care.
 Fast forward again several months, I walk into a party that she is at and shes telling this girl how her "Ex boyfriend forced her to get an abortion against her will"  I told the entire party very loudly exactly what transpired between us, and I realized that she is just frankly crazy.
 there were dozens of more examples of lies and deceit, Will answer any questions.
 Sorry for the wall of text.
