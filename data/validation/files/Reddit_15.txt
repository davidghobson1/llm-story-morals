I've done reading before of different categorized races of alien beings and the one you mentioned kind of sound like the Nordic aliens.
 They are very tall and slender beings, I think with large heads, rather pale white skin with very light blonde hair.
 They are considered the nicest people out there of the known races.
 They don't like seeing life destroyed.
 You might actually say they're almost angelic....
 Which leads to me something peculiar.
 I was once talking about this with a friend, a Catholic Mexican, and she was almost shocked at this because her mom listens to this Catholic radio station of which they were discussing this EXACT FUCKING THING.
 On that program, they were discussing about an alien species that fit the exact description of the Nordics but, they were described as "fallen angels from Heaven.
 "
 
 Even more interesting was when I was on youtube one night (mostly because I was on reddit trying to find things to do in Phoenix) and I watched some video that was a documentary about the Roswell crash.
 Apparently Area 51 is basically an intergalactic embassy, but that's not the point.
 The point of interest here was when in the '50s, an alien being volunteered to be interviewed.
 They don't speak, but communicate through telepathy so the researchers at Area 51 needed the best people who could communicate through telepathy.
 Apparently, these alien beings (I'd presume especially the Nordics) are incredibly spiritual beings.
 They don't fear death, and it seems they believe in reincarnation.
 The body is literally just a vessel for the soul, and technology is only used to make the body more efficient.
 I bet what you experienced was a highly spiritual phenomenon.
 As you said, what happened to you was during a dream like state, your soul could have left your body (mostly your head) and encountered these beings or the beings could have beckoned your soul.
 How fascinating...
