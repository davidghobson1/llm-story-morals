I worked as a CSR at Citibank back in the early to mid-90's.
 It was a pretty sweet gig at the time, with a great group of people that loved to party together on the weekend.
 Unfortunately one of our managers was a complete and utter asshole who was on this crazy power trip throughout the entire day.
 We'd do small things like call 976-sex lines and transfer the calls to her desk, or when she was out, we'd change all her F-key macros to spell out Dr. Dre lyrics, stuff like that.
 One day I walk into the break room at an odd hour, and I see her pouring rubbing alcohol into a can of Sprite.
 Our eyes locked, both our eyes widened for different reasons, her jaw slacked and I smiled.
 We had a little talk, and after that day, my close comrades-in-arms and I came in late whenever we wanted, had extra long lunches all the time,   and always seemed to have our requests for the PTO that we didn't have approved.
 Sadly, two years later they moved CSR to San Antonio, TX, and to her relief, most of the people turned down Citibank's offer to move us there.
