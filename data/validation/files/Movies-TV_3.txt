Rob and Laura have made a pact to get each other a nice gift once a year just because, with no pressure and no competition. This year, Rob has decided to get Laura a $500 fur coat, especially as Laura needs a new coat. Buddy, always with a deal at the ready, says he knows someone who knows someone who can get a deal on such a coat. Rob isn't too sure about Buddy's deal but wants to get something nice and genuine for Laura. Rob eventually succumbs to Buddy's sales tactics if only to see if Buddy's ubiquitous wholesalers really do exist. Despite the somewhat shady process Rob must go through with the wholesaler, Nunzio Vallani - a process which includes fake names, fake orders, a pick-up location way out on Long Island and a non-return policy - Rob can't argue with the $250 price tag for the exact same coat, even if the coat doesn't fit and he will eventually have to get it altered. Laura is forced to pick up the coat herself from a store on Long Island, pretending to be Nunzio's wife, which is difficult pull off since Laura has no idea who Nunzio is. When Laura gets the coat home, it is not only the wrong size - built for someone twice Laura's size - but the wrong style. Rob and Laura have to decide whether to take their loss, try to deal with Nunzio on an exchange, try to sell the coat to a female linebacker, or tell Buddy what a rotten deal his deal ended up being.
