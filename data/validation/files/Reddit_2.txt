I first saw this thread earlier today, and, while, for some reason I am unsure of, I wanted to respond immediately to it, this is the first chance that I've been able to in a situation where I feel secure and safe.
 That's a long way of saying that this is probably going to get buried, and really, I kind of hope it does, but at the same time I also want to tell this story, finally.
 To finally get it off of my chest, even if it is to a bunch of people who could meet me on the street and never know.
 It's important to tell, I think, because a lot of the posters I've seen here have been very matter of fact about some of the horrific things that they have done.
 That's not a judgement on them, at all.
 Most everything I have read here has been, in one lens or another justified.
 But very few people have admitted feeling any guilt, or even any shock at what they did.
 For me, it's totally different.
 I don't feel guilty about what I did.
 I sleep soundly every night, and while I rarely think about the events that happened that day, the thing that always sticks with me, the thing that will never go away, is not what I did, but what I found in myself that day.
 I found a brutality that I never knew existed, and now I wonder and wonder about everyone I meet... do they have it in them also, or is something wrong with me?
 I'm guilty of murder.
 Although I was never caught, and at this point, I highly doubt that I will be, I'm going to be very vague surrounding a lot of the details, just in case.
 It was the summer after I graduated high school, in a state in the Southern United States that has a lot of mountains further in from the coast.
 I lived in a town of medium size, maybe twenty thousand people or so, and on the edge of the town, the outskirts of it backed up to a very large forest that stood at the foot of a mountain.
 My parents had a house that backed up to the woods, and I grew up in those woods, walking them, both with myself and with my friends.
 So, this day, my parents are in town and I decided to go for a walk, which really was a pretty normal experience.
 It was kind of overcast, I think, which made it actually nice to be outside as opposed to the normally oppressive heat of the South.
 I don't remember why I had the knife with me.
 I know for a fact that there wasn't any certain reason for it, other than that I normally took it with me when I went into the woods as a kid, probably because I was always dreaming about being in a survival situation every time I walked back there, even though, at its furthest point, I would have been less than three miles from home (you know how imaginative kids are), but I had stopped doing that probably two years before.
 But for whatever reason, I took it with me that day.
 The trail was really wide in most places, and while the woods weren't the most common place for people to go, it wasn't exactly uncommon to pass people while you were walking it.
 Not everytime, certainly, but maybe every other.
 That's why I wasn't really surprised when I saw him walking towards me.
 The only thing that I remember thinking curious was that I knew he lived on the other side of town, and I couldn't imagine what he was doing in "my" woods.
 It was a kid that I went to school with, a kid that had graduated with me just a couple of weeks before.
 We went to a private school, one affiliated with a certain church, and while most of us were pretty ambivalent about the whole thing, this kid, probably because of his family, was REALLY into Jesus.
 So we stopped and I asked him what he was doing out there, and we chatted for a few minutes and then, not really being too interested in him or anything he had to say, I tried to end the conversation.
 Only he didn't want to.
 He kept tying me back into conversation, asking if I had heard this or that.
 Finally, he looks at me straight faced and says, I'll never forget this, "Jesus went into the wilderness and I bet all he wanted was for someone to suck his bone.
 "
 
 I was floored.
 We hadn't mentioned religion at this point, and we definitely hadn't brought up sex, and out of his mouth comes this fucking thing.
 "Great," I said, and I turned and walked away.
 I was hurrying along when I felt him reach out and grab my shoulder.
 "You hear what I said?
 " he asked.
 I took off, running.
 Like an idiot, I didn't turn and run back towards my house, but I ran further down the path, deeper into the woods.
 He was right behind me, the whole time screaming about someone sucking his bone like Jesus.
 I should mention, probably should have mentioned earlier, but whatever; I wasn't really an in shape kid.
 I walked a lot, I loved the woods, but I wasn't the kind of person to go running, you know?
 So anyway, this kid, who was a lot faster than me, caught up to me pretty quick and tackled me.
 Knocked me off my balance, I think is probably a better description, but in either case, I went down, and I went down pretty hard.
 At this point, he had stopped screaming about Jesus and his bone and whatever had gone really quiet.
 I wanted to scream at him and ask him what the fuck was wrong with him, if he was on drugs or something (I later found out his family had a history of psychological issues, and there were rumors that he had molested his sister), but I had the wind knocked out of me.
