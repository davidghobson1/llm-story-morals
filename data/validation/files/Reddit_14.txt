One of my good friends was babysitting at a neighbor's house one night.
 She had already put the kids to bed, and decided to watch TV for the next few hours until the parents got home.
 The TV was at the back of the house, connecting to the kitchen at the right side of the room and to the dining room at the back.
 There was a large window above the TV.
 As she's watching a random program, she sees something move outside the window.
 She squints to get a better look outside and sees a man standing in the backyard.
 That's all, he's just standing there, staring inside.
 Completely still.
 She gets worried, but knowing that people often cut through the backyard (the house is between two busy streets) she casts it off as a random crazy.
 About ten minutes later, he's still there, so she calls the police.
 The police knock on the door a few minutes later, and she cuts through the kitchen to the front of the house.
 As soon as she openend the door, the police officer immediately became alarmed, drawing his gun and yelling at her to get out of the way.
 As she turned around to let him past she tried to explain that, no, he was outside.
 However, before she could finish, the officer grabs a man standing in the living room.
 The man was never outside.
 He was standing behind the couch in the dining room, staring at her.
 What she saw was his reflection in the window.
