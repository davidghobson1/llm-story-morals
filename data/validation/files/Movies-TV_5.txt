Jackie watches life go by at the hospital. O'Hara brings her coffee, without even slowing down. Jackie goes to a 7-year-old boy being wheeled in. Cooper dances by the mom, excited that he gets to treat a gunshot. Zoey tries to cover for his medical exuberance in the face of tragedy. Jackie and Elenor treat the boy, inserting a chest tube to drain blood. Mo Mo holds the boy's hand, telling him to hang in there. Dr. O'Hara tells the mom her son's lung collapsed. She rattles off other possible problems, including brain damage, spinal cord issues... Jackie winces at her bluntness. Zoey hugs the mom. Jackie talks to her husband. They have some sort of parent-teacher conference they have to go to. But first, Jackie stares at powder in the bathroom. But it's just face powder. She runs into Eddie in the hallway. He offers her a ride. Thanks, but no thanks. She puts on her wedding ring as she walks away. Zoey and Mo Mo watch the mom and her son, the twin of the victim. Mo Mo says he was a twin, but his brother died when they were one. Jackie meets her husband at the school. She shows him the socks she bought him on the street. Her phone rings. She grimaces. It's Eddie. She tells her husband she just lost a patient. They meet with three people, the school nurse and psychologist along with the teacher. They think their daughter has an anxiety disorder. Their youngest walks by the open door and waves. She sees Grace in the hall and tells her their parents are there. Grace is concerned. Dr. O'Hara tells the twins' mom that her son is doing very well. She goes to see him and her other son wraps O'Hara in an immobilizing tiny bear hug. Jackie and her husband check out Grace's drawing. They're impressed with it, but the teacher points out it has no color. They ask if there are problems at home. The staff tells them Grace circles her desk three times before she sits down, so the planes don't fall out of the sky. They suggest she see a shrink and get on a low-dose anxiety medicine. Grace walks in, looking glum. Jackie follows the nurse into the hall. She apologizes, but asks if they're maybe going overboard. The counselor says it's a big deal. Outside, Jackie and her husband try to figure out what to do. Jackie thinks she watches too much news. They discuss private school. They don't end up arguing. Jackie asks him to make tacos for dinner. Jackie's phone beeps. It's Eddie saying he's horny. She looks at the message over her husband's shoulder while hugging him. She buys a disposable cell phone and gives Eddie the number when she gets back. He gives her pills. Zoey whines about being shut out of the interesting cases and Jackie leaves her with an old woman. Cooper drops by and smooth talks the patient. Jackie watches, impressed. O'Hara gives Jackie grief over leaving her alone with the kid and his sticky fingered gratitude. He brings her a drawing and she does her best to seem appreciative. Jackie looks at it, it's full of bright colors and sunshine. Jackie hears a beep and finds that Zoey's old woman has died. She tells her it's never easy, and when it is, it's time to quit. Both of Jackie's cell phones start ringing as she tries to have a somber moment at a dead patient's bedside. She answers both with a "can't talk, love ya." Cooper walks by, loudly celebrating his exciting gun shot wound victim. Zoey wants to put eyebrows on the elderly woman, who worried before about not being made up. Mo Mo sings to the injured twin at his bedside. Jackie looks at her daughter's gray drawing. She takes out a highlighter and draws in a bright sun. "There, was that so hard?" she says.
