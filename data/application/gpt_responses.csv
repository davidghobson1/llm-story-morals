The forest, full of shadows and dappled light, helps these animals hide by making their coats develop blotches and stripes, rendering them nearly invisible to their predators. In response to their inability to catch these cleverly disguised animals, the Leopard and the Ethiopian seek advice from Baviaan, the wise Baboon, who suggests they adapt to their environment as well. The Ethiopian changes his skin color to a blend of black, brown, purple, and blue for better camouflage, while the Leopard, with the Ethiopian's help, gains spots by pressing his blackened fingers onto the Leopard's coat.
